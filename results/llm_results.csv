The speaker is interpreting their feelings of concern as evidence of a potential problem, despite lacking concrete evidence. This reflects basing conclusions primarily on emotional reactions. The key phrase 'I'm very concerned' indicates emotional reasoning where feelings of concern are treated as factual indicators of risk or harm. The phrase 'hope it has nothing to do with my pregnancy' shows uncertainty but is driven by emotion rather than logical evidence. No evidence of predicting the future beyond concern is present, so it's not fortune-telling. The concern is internalized emotionally rather than cognitive labeling or overgeneralization.",Emotional Reasoning
1,I feel trapped inside my disgusting self and like I’m willing to do anything to escape it.I’m just afraid sometimes that since I’m not really thinking during these times that I might do something to myself–especially since I think during these times that I don’t deserve to get help or that I’m not worth disturbing people by calling them.,"""I feel trapped inside my disgusting self"", ""I might do something to myself"", ""I don’t deserve to get help"", ""I’m not worth disturbing people by calling them""","The person is interpreting their feelings of self-disgust as evidence that they are inherently flawed and undeserving of help, which reflects a negative internal evaluation (labeling). They also assume their feelings justify not seeking support, implying a judgment about their worthiness. This is not a prediction about the future (fortune-telling) or an assumption about others' thoughts (mind reading), but a harsh self-assignment of a negative label based on their emotions. Emotional reasoning is present but secondary, as the core distortion is the negative labeling of the self.",Labeling
2,"I refused to go because I didn’t know if it was going to go on my record which could possibly affect my dreams of becoming a psychiatrist.I have a major fear of choking and drowningIt seems like everytime I get so close of beating in, I get nocked right back down to the bottom.","I didn’t know if it was going to go on my record which could possibly affect my dreams of becoming a psychiatrist; I have a major fear of choking and drowning; every time I get so close of beating in, I get knocked right back down to the bottom.","The statement shows concern about an uncertain negative outcome affecting future goals ('didn’t know if it was going to go on my record which could possibly affect my dreams'). This reflects predicting negative outcomes without evidence, which corresponds to Fortune-telling. The latter part of the statement about repeatedly getting knocked back down after getting close to beating in suggests feelings of repeated failure but does not clearly indicate overgeneralization or other distortions as strongly as the initial fear of negative future consequences. The focus is primarily on predicting negative results without definite knowledge.",Fortune-telling
3,"I felt like the response was totally irrational, mean and disrespectful. I felt extremely hurt.","the response was totally irrational, mean and disrespectful; I felt extremely hurt","The statement assumes that the response was irrational, mean, and disrespectful based on the speaker's feeling of being hurt. This indicates that the speaker is using their emotional reaction to determine the truth of the situation. Instead of objectively analyzing the response, they are interpreting it as negative because of how they feel, which is a hallmark of Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
4,"I thought that he displayed traits of honor, loyalty, integrity, honesty, and kind-heartedness, as well as characteristics of a hard worker, and an overall well-rounded individual.","traits of honor, loyalty, integrity, honesty, kind-heartedness, characteristics of a hard worker, overall well-rounded individual","The statement attributes a wide range of positive traits and characteristics to one individual, implying a very positive overall judgment. However, it does not show extremes such as perfect or complete in all aspects (which would indicate All-or-Nothing Thinking), nor does it reflect negative or exaggerated beliefs. It also does not involve predicting the future (Fortune-telling), interpreting others' thoughts (Mind Reading), or incorporating emotional or self-blaming justifications. The statement is simply an observation or evaluation of multiple positive traits, which aligns with labeling someone positively. Labeling can involve assigning a fixed, global trait to someone based on behavior or characteristics, even though here it is positive rather than negative. Thus, this is a case of positive labeling.",Labeling
5,I attributed his behavior to stress – he owned a business that has since failed,I attributed his behavior to stress; he owned a business that has since failed,"The statement involves attributing someone's behavior to a specific cause (stress) based on known external facts (business failure). This shows an interpretation of events rather than an irrational or distorted cognitive pattern. There is no evidence of exaggeration, negative labeling, taking things personally, predicting the future, or seeing things in black-and-white terms. Instead, the speaker is making a reasonable connection between circumstance and behavior. Therefore, this is not indicative of a cognitive distortion but rather a logical assessment.",No Distortion
6,"I had to call off work Friday because I can’t leave him alone at my apartment in fear he will do something and get me evicted, or worse. I’m at the end of my ropes and don’t know what to do.","I can’t leave him alone at my apartment in fear he will do something and get me evicted, or worse. I’m at the end of my ropes and don’t know what to do.","The statement expresses a fear of a negative event happening ('he will do something and get me evicted, or worse') without concrete evidence that it will occur. This reflects predicting a negative future outcome based on anxiety rather than facts. The speaker is mentally forecasting disaster, which aligns with the distortion known as Fortune-telling, where one assumes a negative outcome will inevitably happen.",Fortune-telling
7,"I decided I wasn‚t going to join him again due to the uneasy feeling it gave me which kept me from enjoying myself. Ever since, I have known in the back of my mind that he still does this. believing that it helps keep him „faithful‰ to me since I am no longer interested.",Uneasy feeling that prevented enjoyment; belief that he still does this; belief that it helps keep him faithful since no longer interested.,"The speaker bases their decision and belief on the uneasy feeling they experienced, using this emotional state as evidence of the situation (not enjoying oneself, his ongoing behavior, and its purpose). This reflects emotional reasoning, where feelings are taken as proof of reality. There is no evidence of predicting the future (fortune-telling), labeling, or overgeneralizing multiple incidents from one feeling.",Emotional Reasoning
8,"I don’t know if she’s trying to protect me because she knows how bad it would hurt me if they actually did, or if she really didn’t have full on sex with him.",‘I don’t know if she’s trying to protect me because she knows how bad it would hurt me if they actually did’ and ‘or if she really didn’t have full on sex with him.’,"The statement reflects uncertainty about the other person's intentions and actions, specifically trying to infer what she might be thinking or feeling about a situation. The speaker is attempting to guess the mental state and motivations of 'she' without clear evidence — whether she is protecting the speaker or whether a sexual encounter occurred. This process of assuming knowledge about someone else's thoughts or intentions without direct confirmation matches the distortion known as 'Mind Reading.'",Mind Reading
9,But recently I started thinking about it more and I realized those vague memories were kind of all I had now.,started thinking about it more; vague memories were kind of all I had now,"The statement reflects a focus on only the vague memories as the sole remaining evidence or connection to 'it'. This selective attention to a narrow aspect (vague memories) while ignoring other potentially positive or more concrete memories indicates filtering out broader context or details. This is consistent with the 'Mental filter' distortion, which involves focusing exclusively on certain aspects of a situation and ignoring others.",Mental filter
10,"I feel like he has split personalities. Many times he doesn’t remember tasks he completed days ago. We are at a stressful time in our relationship which includes the 6 month old baby. We used to be best friends and still today sometimes we enjoy time shared with the baby, but I see more and more he has no idea of what I’m referring to because he asks, “huh?” all the time. There has been lingering problems. I really don’t understand any of this and I’m falling deeply into depression myself that along with the baby weight I can’t shed. If I ask him for the truth he will simply look me in the face and tell another lie. {I can’t bear it, seriously.}","""I feel like he has split personalities."", ""Many times he doesn’t remember tasks he completed days ago."", ""We are at a stressful time in our relationship..."", ""If I ask him for the truth he will simply look me in the face and tell another lie."", ""I can’t bear it, seriously.""","The statement includes an extreme and negative label ""he has split personalities"" that categorizes the other person in a rigid and negative way based on frustration and observed behavior. This reflects Labeling, which is assigning a global negative tag to someone instead of focusing on specific behaviors or situations. The speaker generalizes specific instances of forgetfulness and dishonesty to a broad, negative personal trait. There is also emotional reasoning present, but the strongest distortion is Labeling because the person is being labeled with a severe mental condition without evidence, which goes beyond interpreting isolated events emotionally.",Labeling
11,During this time I was recruited to many great jobs but was scared to take them and instead started my own dot-com business.,"""was scared to take them""; ""started my own dot-com business""","The phrase ""was scared to take them"" indicates the speaker's feeling of fear influencing their decision-making. There is no indication that they predict future events negatively (which would be fortune-telling), nor do they generalize or label themselves negatively. The statement reflects an emotional state (fear) guiding their actions, suggesting emotional reasoning where feelings dictate thoughts and behaviors.",Emotional Reasoning
12,"Why can she look like that but I have to work to keep myself healthy? Why are such high expectations put on me that she doesn’t live up to? She is my biggest role model, and all I can think of at this moment is starving myself until I look like her.But when she’s not…my motivation goes away and I want to restrict.","""Why can she look like that but I have to work to keep myself healthy?"", ""Why are such high expectations put on me that she doesn’t live up to?"", ""all I can think of at this moment is starving myself until I look like her"", ""when she’s not…my motivation goes away and I want to restrict.""","The statement highlights a dichotomous view where the speaker believes their role model can look a certain way effortlessly, while they must work hard and still feel inadequate. The phrase 'all I can think of…starving myself until I look like her' suggests an extreme, binary mindset about achieving an ideal physical state. Additionally, the motivation is all-or-nothing, disappearing completely when the role model is not present or inspiring. This indicates rigid, black-and-white thinking typical of All-or-Nothing Thinking, rather than a more nuanced or probabilistic view.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
13,"I am highly disorganized, I’m concerned with being diagnosed with schizophrenia or something like that","""I am highly disorganized"", ""I’m concerned with being diagnosed with schizophrenia or something like that""","The first phrase shows self-labeling as ""highly disorganized,"" which fits the 'Labeling' distortion. The concern about being diagnosed with schizophrenia suggests a negative prediction about the future without evidence, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling.' However, these two distortions cannot both be the final label; we must choose the most overarching one. The labeling part ('I am highly disorganized') frames the person with a negative, global identity which often leads to the subsequent worry ('concerned with... diagnosis'). The root distortion guiding the thought process is 'Labeling,' since it sets a negative self-identity that likely triggers the worry. The worry about diagnosis is a consequence rather than the primary distortion. Therefore, the primary distortion is 'Labeling.'",Labeling
14,I was a very difficult child to raise. There was constant fighting between myself and my parents.I couldn’t talk to anyone because I had no trust in adults.,I was a very difficult child to raise; There was constant fighting between myself and my parents; I couldn’t talk to anyone because I had no trust in adults.,"The statement 'I was a very difficult child to raise' assigns a negative, fixed label to oneself, which aligns with labeling. The phrase 'constant fighting' indicates ongoing conflict but does not necessarily imply a cognitive distortion by itself. The lack of trust in adults leading to not talking to anyone may show a broad, generalized view of adults, but the defining distortion here is the use of a negative, global label on oneself ('very difficult child to raise'). This is characteristic of the Labeling distortion, where one attaches a negative label to themselves based on past behavior or conflicts.",Labeling
15,"When someone tries to talk to me, I get so nervous about what they think of me that I end up seeming uninterested or maybe even snobby, probably. Im always thinking that people are talking behind my back or thinking badly of me.

Whenever someone is whispering to another person, I pretty much assume that they are talking badly about me. Im always thinking that people think I'm a loser. I imagine everyone is looking at me funny.","The key phrases indicate that the person frequently makes assumptions about what others think without any concrete evidence. For instance, assuming people whispering are talking badly about them, or thinking others see them negatively. This reflects the belief that one can know others' thoughts and feelings directly, which is characteristic of 'Mind Reading'. Other distortions like Fortune-telling could be relevant, but the emphasis is specifically on assuming knowledge of others' thoughts, not predicting future events. Therefore, the cognitive distortion that best fits is 'Mind Reading'.",Mind Reading
16,"everything was perfect and I trusted him whole-heartedly. Up until recently I’ve been very suspicious and my trust just keeps going down. I started to lose trust when finding a text message in his phone from someone calling him “babe” on Valentines Day. He said it was nothing like that, and I asked to see the rest of the messages from that person but he said no because he thought that would change the dynamics of our relationship and that I am supposed to just trust him, so I let it go. Ever since that occasion it’s been so hard for me to trust him like I did in the beginning. But I almost feel like I’m convincing myself because I just have this feeling inside. Should I end this relationship before I get hurt or wait it out and see if it can really become as good as I thought it could?",I’ve been very suspicious and my trust just keeps going down; I almost feel like I’m convincing myself because I just have this feeling inside; Should I end this relationship before I get hurt or wait it out and see if it can really become as good as I thought it could?,"The key issue revolves around the person having a strong feeling of distrust without solid evidence, almost 'convincing' themselves based on an internal feeling rather than objective facts. They worry about getting hurt in the future and are trying to predict the outcome of the relationship, questioning whether to end it before potential pain occurs. This reflects a type of thinking where negative outcomes are anticipated as if they are certain, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling.' The person is forecasting a negative future despite uncertainty. Other distortions like Emotional Reasoning are present but less central, as the main cognitive distortion applied here is predicting a negative future outcome without conclusive proof.",Fortune-telling
17,"But sometimes I can’t help what I say to my parents. If they’re in my face yelling about what I just said or how I forgot to do something, how can I not yell back? My parents say its disrespect, but I feel that they have no respect for me when they’re yelling in my face.But to avoid these confrontations I feel the only way to do this is to COMPLETELY IGNORE my whole family.

This reflects Emotional Reasoning: assuming that because they feel disrespected, it must be true. Additionally, the speaker decides the only solution is to 'completely ignore' their family and avoids addressing the situation directly, which shows reliance on emotional discomfort to guide their perception and decisions rather than objective evidence or alternative explanations. Other distortions like Overgeneralization or All-or-Nothing Thinking are less fitting because the main process is interpreting feelings as facts rather than broad generalizations or dichotomous thinking.",Emotional Reasoning
18,"Then, I decided to become vegetarian and anorexic. To tell you the truth, I wasn’t a complete vegan at first. I was “98% vege”, meaning that I ate hotdogs/hamburgers/chicken nuggets/bacon/top ramen soup. In seventh grade, I became full-fledged vege, and continued to have problems.

This implies a shift from a flexible approach to an all-or-nothing mindset regarding diet (either mostly vegetarian or fully vegetarian with strict rules). The term 'food nazi' also reinforces a black-and-white or perfectionist attitude. There is no indication of emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, or other distortions; instead, the narrative reflects rigid dichotomous thinking patterns typical of all-or-nothing thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

Words like 'always happy' and 'never argued' indicate a failure to acknowledge any negative aspects or normal fluctuations in relationships, which exemplifies an all-or-nothing perspective rather than a balanced view.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

Additionally, the speaker anticipates a negative future outcome (taking him to small claims court) without certainty, which reflects Fortune-telling. However, the dominant cognitive distortion here is Mind Reading because the initial judgment about disinterest is drawn from perceived signals rather than explicit communication.",Mind Reading

This involves making a negative prediction about how others will react without evidence, which aligns with predicting the future negatively. Therefore, the cognitive distortion here is anticipating a negative outcome without certainty.",Fortune-telling

They express a belief that the father 'should' treat both equally, implying an expectation or rule about fairness. This indicates a 'should statement' distortion, where rigid demands or rules about how things 'should' be create distress. While the speaker may be feeling upset, the core distortion stems from their insistence that their father must treat them both the same way.",Should statements
24,I always feel like people talk about me and hav had suicidal thouts before.,"""I always feel like people talk about me"" and ""had suicidal thoughts before""","The key phrase 'I always feel like people talk about me' indicates a belief that others are consistently engaging in negative behavior toward the speaker without concrete evidence. This reflects assuming knowledge of others' thoughts or intentions, which fits the definition of 'Mind Reading.' The mention of 'had suicidal thoughts before' appears to be additional personal disclosure and does not represent a cognitive distortion in this context. Therefore, the primary distortion is 'Mind Reading' because the speaker presumes to know what others are thinking.",Mind Reading

(Everything is always my fault according to him.),"""He is really immature."", ""He never accepts responsibility for his part in any problem."", ""Everything is always my fault according to him.""","The statement includes a negative, global judgment about the other person by calling him ""really immature,"" which is a label rather than an objective assessment. This label oversimplifies the person's behavior and character without nuance. The speaker also generalizes about the other person's refusal to take responsibility, which supports the labeling. Thus, the core distortion lies in assigning a negative label to a person rather than focusing on specific behaviors or situations.",Labeling

Despite evidence to the contrary (partner's honesty and affection), the speaker still 'can’t trust him' and seeks to control his actions and interactions. This indicates that their feelings (anxiety and mistrust) are driving their belief about the partner's trustworthiness rather than objective evidence. This aligns with emotional reasoning, where feelings are taken as proof of reality. The desire to control and the mistrust coexist with factual contrary evidence, showing the distortion is rooted in emotions rather than facts.",Emotional Reasoning

This indicates the speaker is personalizing the situation — taking responsibility for external events or others' feelings without clear evidence. It is not emotional reasoning, because the feeling is stated but the attribution to self as cause points more directly to personalization rather than just basing truth on feelings. It is not mind reading, because the speaker is not assuming others’ thoughts, but rather blaming themselves. Therefore, the core cognitive distortion here is Personalization.",Personalization

Feeling like a failure most of the time also supports this pattern, as it generalizes occasional setbacks to a pervasive, all-encompassing feeling of failure. This is not about a black-and-white view of situations (All-or-Nothing), nor about interpreting feelings as facts (Emotional Reasoning), nor predicting future events (Fortune-telling), or imposing labels on oneself unrelated to evidence (Labeling). It most clearly exemplifies Overgeneralization, where a single or few negative experiences are taken as a global and permanent truth.",Overgeneralization
29,I know your advice is to be the bigger person.,I know your advice is to be the bigger person.,"The key phrase 'I know your advice' implies the speaker is assuming they understand the other person's thoughts or intentions without explicit confirmation.

Therefore, the statement exhibits the 'Mind Reading' distortion.",Mind Reading
30,"I have realized that the major internal problem I have is that I lack an identity, lack interests, lack emotions, and therefore have trouble with social interaction.

I care about nothing–not politics or current events, not my friends or family or other people, not sports or music or art. Outwardly, I am a high-achieving, well-rounded student.Occasionally a particularly poignant tragedy or example will make feel like helping out, but on the whole, I am completely apathetic. The same goes for the social aspects of my life. My childhood, family, and friendships were and are normal, but I do not have emotional connections to anyone; if somebody ‘close’ to me died, I would only be concerned with how it would affect my own convenience.

The individual generalizes this lack of feelings and interests to every domain (social, academic, emotional) and assumes it is a fixed internal problem. This is a classic example of overgeneralization, where one perceives isolated difficulties or feelings as a pervasive, universal flaw without exceptions. The presence of absolutes like 'I care about nothing,' 'I don’t have any… interests,' and the belief that the problem is internal and unchangeable supports this interpretation.",Overgeneralization

The focus on being a 'bad mother' is a classic example of labeling, where a person assigns a negative, global label to themselves based on fears or isolated incidents rather than facts. Although there is some fortune-telling (worrying about what might happen, like losing the family), the core cognitive distortion here is labeling, as it involves defining oneself negatively.",Labeling

This suggests a pattern drawn from repeated instances and generalized to all instances.

The individual perceives a significant change in their emotional experiences, focusing mainly on the lack of emotional highs and lows and the flatness of life. There is a generalization of this experience over a period of years, suggesting a broad conclusion from ongoing feelings rather than a specific event. The person states that emotions ‘seem to have left me,’ and ‘things just entertain and occupy’ without pleasure, which indicates a negative global outlook regarding their emotional life.

For example if I got a call saying that my mother died, I don’t think I would even cry.I want to ask my parents, or anyone for help, but I’m afraid of being laughed at.I observe everyone’s actions with relationships and reasoning and feel like everyone is, for lack of a better term, retarded.For example, if I call a friend and they don’t answer I immediately think they are ignoring me and go into a downward spiral of depression until I hear back from them.",I immediately think they are ignoring me and go into a downward spiral of depression until I hear back from them.,"The person assumes that just because a friend does not answer the phone, the friend is deliberately ignoring them. There is no evidence provided to support this assumption, and the belief is made without confirmation or concrete information. This reflects an attempt to predict a negative outcome or assume what others are thinking without proof, fitting the definition of 'Fortune-telling.' Other distortions like Mind Reading could also be considered, but the focus is on anticipating a negative outcome (being ignored) rather than directly assuming what the friend thinks.",Fortune-telling

The claim that ""the rest of them had betrayed me"" suggests a broad, sweeping conclusion about many friends based on a few events, which indicates overgeneralization. The phrase ""huge falling out with some... best friends"" may also heighten the negativity of the event, hinting at magnification. However, the primary cognitive distortion is the speaker taking full responsibility for the issue (personalization) and generalizing the betrayal to the entire group (overgeneralization). Since the statement focuses on blaming oneself and others in a generalized way, overgeneralization best captures the distortion.",Overgeneralization

The phrase 'should already do for his girlfriend' indicates the presence of 'should statements' where the speaker is asserting how the boyfriend ought to behave. The complaints about constant negative behavior suggest a broad expectation rather than isolated events, but the key cognitive distortion is identified by the presence of 'should' in describing expected behaviors.",Should statements

The speaker acknowledges awareness and occasional communication among these parts, and there is no evidence of negative, distorted thinking patterns such as black-and-white thinking, catastrophizing, or labeling. The description appears factual and self-reflective without cognitively distorted conclusions. Therefore, the statement fits best with 'No Distortion.'",No Distortion

The phrase 'I can’t do anything' indicates a negative global assessment of ability, reinforcing this overgeneralization. The mention of escaping into fantasy as the only relief hints at emotional reasoning — using feelings of helplessness and escape to justify actions and judgments about reality. However, the core cognitive distortion lies in the broad, definitive conclusion about antidepressants being ineffective ('never really helped') and inability to act, which aligns best with Overgeneralization.

The belief that she 'lies constantly' and is 'always changing' stories involves overgeneralization. However, the key distortion is the strong negative labeling about her character and condition. The speaker is also engaging in mind reading by assuming the woman has another man coaching her, without evidence. Despite this, the primary distortion that underlies the statement is 'Labeling' because it broadly and negatively defines the person’s character and mental state based on limited behavior.",Labeling

This reflects a black-and-white view of the person's character without acknowledging any middle ground or nuance. The phrase ""He has no remorse"" further reinforces an absolute judgment about his emotional state. The conclusion that ""He is depressed"" seems to be inferred as an explanation but doesn't mitigate the initial absolute labeling.

This assumption that others have negative judgments is a form of mind reading. Additionally, the speaker’s decision to change majors is partly motivated by the desire to stop others' perceived negative commentary. There is uncertainty about personal desires, but the core distortion lies in assuming negative perceptions from others. Other distortions like personalization or emotional reasoning are less fitting because the focus is on assumed external judgment rather than internal feelings or self-blame.",Mind Reading

However, despite this perceived victory, a severe panic attack occurred, contradicting their expectation that the battle was over. This suggests a black-and-white, either/or mindset—either winning completely or the struggle continuing—which fits the pattern of All-or-Nothing Thinking.

This reflects an overgeneralization distortion because the person applies a single pattern to all men they have dated, ignoring exceptions or nuances. While the statement acknowledges taking out hurt on a current partner and recognizes unfairness, the core distortion lies in the broad, absolute claim about all past relationships.",Overgeneralization

The statement focuses on the persistence and amplification of difficulties over time and the worsening condition. There is a tendency to view the situation in a broad, sweeping negative way without acknowledging exceptions or positive aspects, such as any friendships that might exist or improvements.

The person is observing a factual progression, not making a broad or absolute judgment. There is no indication of assuming how the partner feels (no mind reading), no extreme all-or-nothing statements, no magnification of negative aspects beyond the observed facts, and no blaming or personalization.

This assumption is made without concrete evidence and is based largely on their fear and uncertainty. However, after reflection, they acknowledge a more rational explanation that he was just dropping her off. The worry and fear arose from interpreting ambiguous situations negatively and prematurely.

This suggests a focusing on the negative aspect of no close friends (mental filter), but more importantly, the speaker assumes others (everybody) are going to fun places, which implies an overgeneralization about other people's social lives. There is also personal implication in feeling isolated due to this lack, but no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or fortune-telling.

This reflects an all-or-nothing stance where fantasy is either acceptable (far away, hidden) or unacceptable (disgusting, needing effort), without a middle ground or gradual acceptance.

However, there is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or magnifying the situation beyond its impact. The wife demanding the move and the speaker interpreting it as 'that wasn't my problem anymore' reveals emotional reasoning but primarily the speaker is taking personal blame for the issues.

The phrase 'everyone thinks' indicates assuming what others think without evidence, which aligns with 'Mind Reading.' However, the key aspect here is the flip between feeling totally awful and totally awesome with no middle ground, suggesting an all-or-nothing perspective on self-worth. The person is alternating between extremes, which exemplifies 'All-or-Nothing Thinking.'

But, I thought about what would happen if he killed himself and now I want him to do it, I want him to die.","I thought about what would happen if he killed himself and now I want him to do it, I want him to die.","The statement involves the speaker shifting from concern to a desire for a negative outcome (wanting him to die) based on strong emotional turmoil and frustration. It reflects a black-and-white evaluation of the situation and person, without middle ground or nuance. This suggests an extreme, polarized thinking pattern. The speaker is not expressing a balanced or proportional reaction, but instead an extreme position possibly as a defense or emotional overload. This matches the characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where things are seen in absolutes.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
73,My question is if there is a connection between early brain health and major recurrent depression,My question is if there is a connection between early brain health and major recurrent depression,"The statement is posed as a question exploring a possible connection between two factors.

The speaker is seeking information or clarification about a potential link without making an absolute or distorted judgment.",No Distortion
74,We have been dating for 7 months now and my parents will not approve.,my parents will not approve,The statement assumes a definite outcome about the parents' feelings without evidence; it predicts a negative reaction as a certainty.

The speaker then internally rejects this label based on their own feelings and experiences, emphasizing that they have never behaved like that before. This shows the use of 'Labeling' cognitive distortion, where a person assigns a negative label to themselves or believes others might do so, without considering the broader context or other explanations.",Labeling

I broke up that guy’s marriage and I didn’t love him.,I never forgave myself for cheating on him; I broke up that guy’s marriage; I didn’t love him.,"The speaker expresses a strong self-judgment ('I never forgave myself'), attributing the breakup of another marriage to their own actions and suggesting a moral failing. This reveals intense self-blame and guilt. However, there isn't a clear pattern of thinking that fits All-or-Nothing, Fortune-telling, Labeling, or other distortions. The key is the self-blame ('I never forgave myself') driven by negative emotions. This indicates Emotional Reasoning, where the person concludes they are at fault and deserve blame because they feel bad about the situation.",Emotional Reasoning

Despite this, the speaker experiences ongoing paranoia and a persistent belief that the partner will cheat in the future, without evidence or clear reason. This involves predicting a negative outcome (partner cheating) despite the factual past evidence to the contrary. This aligns with 'Fortune-telling,' where the person assumes a future negative event will happen unjustifiably.",Fortune-telling

This indicates reliance on internal emotional state as evidence of reality ('I just can't act normal'), which aligns with Emotional Reasoning. There is no indication of extreme 'all-or-nothing' thinking, predicting the future (fortune-telling), labeling themselves or others, magnifying negative aspects, filtering selectively, assuming thoughts of others, overgeneralizing, personalizing unrelated events, or prescribing 'should' statements.",Emotional Reasoning

The speaker recognizes the friend as wonderful and a best friend, which shows balanced thinking rather than all-or-nothing. The concern about negative aspects emerges specifically in the context of considering engagement. This suggests selective attention to negative information ('negative aspects'), which can be a form of mental filter—focusing only on the negative parts while possibly ignoring the positives. There is no evidence of labeling the person negatively, predicting future outcomes (fortune-telling), assuming thoughts or feelings of the other (mind reading), or emotional reasoning where feelings are equated to facts. Thus, the distortion aligns most closely with the mental filter type.",Mental filter

This reflects a prediction about how well therapy will go based on gender and the issue's nature. It is not an absolute or extreme thought (which would suggest All-or-Nothing Thinking), nor is it labeling or magnifying. It is also not emotional reasoning or mind reading since it is a prediction about future benefit.

The speaker categorizes themselves broadly as a 'normal teenage girl' with certain traits (partying, uncertainty about identity, sadness, insecurity). This is not an extreme either/or evaluation but rather a broad sweeping summary of identity and experience.

This reflects a concern about a potential negative label ('shallow') being applied to them. The key distortion here is 'Labeling' because the person is worried about a global negative judgment (being called shallow) based on their feelings. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or other distortions in the statement.",Labeling

The phrase ‘What’s wrong with me?!’ followed by the question ‘Do I have schizophrenia or something?!’ shows that they are labeling themselves with a severe mental illness based on their experiences. This is a clear example of labeling because the person is defining their entire self-worth and identity by these perceived symptoms and fears, assigning a negative and stigmatizing label to themselves. While there is emotional reasoning (assuming symptoms prove something is wrong), the primary distortion is labeling since the focus is on naming themselves as having schizophrenia or being 'wrong'.",Labeling

This conclusion is drawn without concrete evidence. The person is predicting negative future behavior (that she 'will do it again') and is making a generalized negative assumption about the other person's character based on limited interactions. This is indicative of Fortune-telling (predicting negative outcomes without evidence) combined with Overgeneralization (believing that because one event happened, it will always happen).

The key distortion here is the emotional interpretation of events—feeling upset at even the smallest criticism and interpreting nervousness as a problem affecting assignments. The individual uses feelings of anxiety and upsetness as evidence for negative conclusions about themselves and their abilities, which aligns with emotional reasoning. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, mind reading, or fortune-telling in this description.

This shows an assumption about what the other person was feeling or thinking without concrete evidence, aligning with the distortion where one assumes they know another person's thoughts or feelings. There is no direct evidence given that confirms the person's real reasons beyond the arguments. Therefore, the cognitive distortion involved here is Mind Reading.",Mind Reading

The mention that most jobs ended negatively suggests the person is drawing a broad conclusion about all their employment experiences based on repeated negative outcomes. This generalization goes beyond the specific instances and assumes a persistent problem across all jobs, which fits the pattern of overgeneralization. There is no indication that the person is thinking in absolute extremes (all-or-nothing), making emotional conclusions without evidence (emotional reasoning), or predictive assumptions (fortune-telling). Labeling would involve assigning a negative label to themselves (e.g., 'I am a failure'), which is not explicitly stated. Thus, the core distortion here is the sweeping conclusion about jobs based on multiple instances of job loss or layoff.",Overgeneralization
111,"It feels like the world is collapsing in on me. That is why I stay inside a lot, and play my video games.","""It feels like the world is collapsing in on me.""","The key phrase expresses a feeling that the world is metaphorically 'collapsing' specifically on the speaker, suggesting an intense emotional experience that is interpreted as an objective truth. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the individual's feelings are taken as evidence of reality—i.e., because they feel overwhelmed, they conclude that the world is literally collapsing in on them. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions here—it is primarily the use of emotions to validate the perceived state of the world.",Emotional Reasoning
112,"There are only two people in my life that I trust to help me out in a sticky situation, but sometimes I cannot trust them to keep personal conversations that we have to their selves.","There are only two people in my life that I trust to help me out in a sticky situation, but sometimes I cannot trust them to keep personal conversations that we have to their selves.","The speaker states there are only two people they trust, which suggests a limited trust circle. The phrase 'sometimes I cannot trust them to keep personal conversations' indicates a recognition that trust is sometimes broken, but not always. The use of 'only two people' might hint at viewing trust in black-and-white terms, but the acknowledgment of 'sometimes' introduces nuance. The key cognitive distortion would involve interpreting this trust dynamic inaccurately. The phrase 'only two people' suggests a limited trust and possibly an either/or perspective limited to a small group, leaning toward either complete trust or doubt. This could be seen as 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' if it were stated in a more absolute way, but the sentence admits some trust and some mistrust within those two people. Overgeneralization would involve making a sweeping general conclusion based on limited instances. Emotional Reasoning would mean the person feels untrustworthy so concludes they cannot trust. Mind Reading would mean assuming others will betray trust without evidence. Here, the statement is a factual claim with some ambivalence, pointing toward a mild form of All-or-Nothing Thinking due to the categorization of only two people trusted for a significant need, but the admission of 'sometimes' reduces the absoluteness. There is no definite evidence of other distortions like labeling or magnification. Given all this, the best fit is Overgeneralization, as the speaker has limited the category of people they trust to only two, possibly because of some instances of mistrust, generalizing trustworthiness across broader populations based on few examples.",Overgeneralization

They assume others think poorly of them and label themselves as 'not a nice person.' This involves assuming knowledge of others' thoughts and feelings, which is characteristic of 'Mind Reading.' The fear of misjudgment and the belief that it happens 'sometimes or maybe all the time' reinforce this distortion, as it projects presumed negative thoughts onto others rather than relying on actual facts.",Mind Reading

This aligns with 'Fortune-telling,' a cognitive distortion where one assumes they can predict the future negatively without proof. There is no absolute or exaggerated black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), no emotional conclusion about reality (Emotional Reasoning), nor labeling or personalization evident. The key aspect is the expectation or fear of negative future events.",Fortune-telling

This reflects predicting a negative future outcome (the end of the world) and allowing that belief to dictate current behavior and attitude. The statement 'I have been thinking about the end of the world in 2012 and figure why bother doing anything' exemplifies predicting a catastrophic event with certainty and basing decisions on that prediction, which matches the definition of Fortune-telling distortion.",Fortune-telling

They generalize recent events ('another relationship ruined') to imply a continuous and inevitable failure, which points to a black-and-white view of their social interactions. This is characteristic of Overgeneralization, where a single negative event is seen as a never-ending pattern of defeat. Although there are elements of self-criticism and low self-worth, the dominant distortion is overgeneralizing from a few negative experiences to an absolute negative self-assessment.",Overgeneralization

The speaker implies that because they felt emotionally overwhelmed, they interpreted the situation negatively and made a significant decision (dropping out). This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are used as evidence for truth despite contradictory facts (good grades). There is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions in the phrasing provided.",Emotional Reasoning

Additionally, the speaker assumes others will judge them negatively, leading to shame and silence. The dominant distortion here is predicting a negative outcome without evidence, fitting the 'Fortune-telling' distortion. While shame and avoidance hint at other distortions like 'Emotional Reasoning', the primary driver is fear based on anticipated future events.",Fortune-telling

The speaker is attributing personal identity labels based on current feelings and doubts. Although there are elements of worry about the future, the core distortion is the negative self-labeling rather than fortune-telling alone, as the individual defines themselves as flawed based on internal uncertainty and desires.",Labeling

This suggests a negative global characterization based on selective aspects of behavior and personality, highlighting presumed inadequacies or flaws.

The phrase 'she takes all her issues out on me' implies the speaker is personalizing the partner's distress. Additionally, feeling like 'there is no hope for us' suggests a broader negative outlook on the relationship potentially driven by perceived personal blame. The speaker does not claim to know exactly what the partner is thinking (no clear mind reading) but interprets the partner's actions as being targeted at them adversly. This fits the pattern of personalization, where one takes responsibility for or feels targeted by another person's mood or behavior.",Personalization

They are uncertain about the situation but lean toward concluding therapy might have ended its usefulness ('Maybe therapy has run its course'), which implies making a prediction about the future without sufficient facts. This reflects an assumption about what will happen next ('therapy has run its course') based on feelings and uncertainty rather than facts.

Phrases like 'I have gained back all the weight,' 'I feel alone in my life,' 'I have no close friends,' and 'nothing to look forward to' indicate that the person is making sweeping negative conclusions drawn from specific experiences. This reflects a pattern where one negative event or feeling is extended to multiple areas of life, consistent with overgeneralization. There is no indication of black-and-white thinking (all-or-nothing), only magnifying negatives or labeling oneself outright.

The speaker attributes all relationship troubles exclusively to the wife's suspicious nature, showing a one-sided explanation.

Additionally, the speaker acknowledges wanting to have a mental illness, which could indicate complicated self-perception, but the core distortion is the act of labeling oneself with a stigmatizing term. This fits best with 'Labeling,' as it involves attaching a global negative label rather than just acknowledging specific symptoms or behaviors.",Labeling

This seems to involve drawing a broad, negative conclusion about their overall parenting ability from this one aspect. This could suggest overgeneralization or labeling. However, the key is that the speaker feels they are not a 'good parent'—a self-label—because of this situation. Therefore, it is more of a labeling distortion (assigning a global negative label to the self) rather than overgeneralizing multiple events.",Labeling

The use of 'always' suggests the speaker is applying one experience to a broad and enduring conclusion about themselves. Although the speaker acknowledges some challenges (difficulty focusing, needing to reread), they also identify as a 'good reader,' showing some balanced insight. However, the main cognitive distortion is that of overgeneralization—drawing a sweeping conclusion about themselves based on repeated incidents. This is not all-or-nothing thinking, as the speaker does not describe the situation in absolute good/bad terms. It is not mind reading or personalization because the focus is on their own traits and patterns, not assumptions about others' thoughts or feelings. The extra comments about how others get mad are more observational than distorted beliefs. Hence, the dominant distortion is Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

It also does not involve reasoning solely based on feelings (emotional reasoning), nor does it magnify or filter information selectively.

The phrase 'I don’t even know how to meet new people anymore' and the pervasive sense of hopelessness 'what do I have to live for' show a broad, overreaching negative conclusion. The person is also interpreting the relationship in an absolute way, believing they are a burden based on another's comment.

The speaker also predicts that the counsellor would want them to tell their mom, who would then make them eat at the table again, assuming negative future events without certainty (fortune-telling).

This reflects an 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' pattern, where the situation is seen in absolute terms (either fully able to work and achieve the goal, or entirely unable and the goal is unreachable).

This reflects a rigid, black-and-white perspective on recovery and emotional openness. There is an underlying assumption of a fixed timeline and that failure to meet it equals permanent failure. This aligns most closely with all-or-nothing thinking because the person sees the situation in absolutes (either they have gotten better or they have not, with no middle ground or gradual progress).",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The phrase ‘completely disappear’ and ‘changed to people I hate the most’ reflects an extreme, black-and-white view without middle ground. The individual interprets their emotional response in an absolute way, suggesting the people are either wholly loved or wholly hated depending on the emotional state.

176,I’m 16 and this year was the worst for me.,"""this year was the worst for me""","The phrase ""this year was the worst for me"" suggests a sweeping negative judgment about the entire year based on possibly limited or specific negative experiences. This is a classic sign of overgeneralization, where a single or few negative events lead to a broad and absolute conclusion. It is not necessarily all-or-nothing thinking because it does not indicate an absolute good or bad binary but rather an extreme negative generalization. It is not labeling, which involves assigning a fixed, global identity to oneself or others, nor is it emotional reasoning, which would imply basing truth on feelings. It's also distinct from mental filter or magnification because the statement is a broad evaluation rather than focusing on one specific detail or exaggerating an aspect. Therefore, the most fitting distortion type here is overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

This is an example of anticipating a negative outcome without sufficient evidence, which aligns with Fortune-telling.

The main concern is worry about continuous new problems, indicating focus on negative occurrences (could suggest mental filter). However, the statement 'everyday something new is wrong' generalizes the situation as constantly negative, implying an overall negative pattern rather than isolated events. The phrase 'I get that people age' acknowledges a normal process, suggesting awareness rather than distortion.

The speaker seems to infer a negative intent or a lack of loyalty based on the husband's behavior, despite his verbal assurances. This suggests the speaker is assuming they know the husband's thoughts or feelings (that he isn’t truly 'on their side'), without direct evidence of his internal state. This aligns with Mind Reading, where one assumes the thoughts, intentions, or feelings of others without explicit communication.",Mind Reading

This is an example of anticipating an unfavorable outcome without concrete evidence. The focus is on future negative possibilities, which aligns with the distortion of predicting negative outcomes without certainty.",Fortune-telling
196,"While I am devastated about his loss, I also feel an odd sense of guilt and envy because he actually did what I’ve always wanted to/thought about doing.",feel an odd sense of guilt and envy because he actually did what I’ve always wanted to/thought about doing,"The statement involves feeling guilt and envy linked to someone else achieving what the speaker has desired. This reflects taking the situation personally and attributing the cause of their feelings inward, despite it being about another person's actions. The guilt and envy indicate a distorted personal attribution where the individual's feelings are tied directly to another's success, suggesting a cognitive distortion where one personalizes events unnecessarily.",Personalization
197,I’m 26 years old disabled and my mother controls everything and lies about everything.,"""my mother controls everything"" and ""lies about everything""","The key phrases imply an absolute and generalized judgment about the mother's behavior, suggesting that she controls and lies about everything without exception. This indicates an overgeneralization where specific incidents or behaviors are viewed as applying universally, rather than considering exceptions or nuances.",Overgeneralization

A part of me wonders if this all karma, and I’m actually a bad person, or a narcissist thats suffering the consequences of her actions.","The statement involves key elements where the person assumes what others are thinking and feeling without direct evidence, specifically believing their friends want them gone for having a better time. This is a classic example of 'Mind Reading,' where one presumes to know the thoughts and intentions of others. Additionally, the speaker labels themselves as a 'bad person' or 'narcissist' suffering karma, which touches on 'Labeling,' but the primary distortion is the assumption about friends' thoughts and feelings leading to feelings of isolation and mistrust.",Mind Reading

This aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Fortune-telling, where one assumes to know what will happen in the future without sufficient evidence. The mention of realizations popping up and claiming honesty does not indicate distortions like emotional reasoning or labeling. The focus is on making an assumption about future events or dialogue.",Fortune-telling

This suggests the person is generalizing a specific experience to all similar situations without exceptions. The feeling of always putting on an act also supports a generalized negative self-assessment during social interactions. These features characterize Overgeneralization, where one negative experience is applied universally to all cases.",Overgeneralization
201,my worst fear is that ill end up crazy or Schizophrenic.,my worst fear is that ill end up crazy or Schizophrenic,"The statement involves predicting a negative outcome (ending up crazy or schizophrenic) without evidence, based purely on fear. This aligns with making a negative prediction about the future, which is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling'. It is not labeling because the person is not identifying themselves with a negative label but predicting a possible future. It is not emotional reasoning as the statement is a prediction rather than a conclusion based on emotion. There is no all-or-nothing language or personalization. Therefore, the distortion is best identified as Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

Additionally, hearing voices is not a cognitive distortion but a potential symptom of a perceptual or psychological condition, so it doesn’t fit the listed distortions. The primary distortion evident here is the assumption about others' thoughts without proof, fitting 'Mind Reading'.",Mind Reading
203,No one believes me when i try to explain it to them.,"""No one believes me""","The phrase ""No one believes me"" implies that the speaker assumes they know what others are thinking without concrete evidence or confirmation.

204,I often think I am a failure but sometime in am cocky.,"""I often think I am a failure""; ""sometimes I am cocky""","The key phrase 'I often think I am a failure' shows a sweeping negative judgment about oneself that generalizes specific instances to a broad negative label. The word 'often' suggests this belief is applied frequently and broadly. This indicates overgeneralization, where a single or some negative experiences lead to a global conclusion about oneself. The phrase 'sometimes I am cocky' introduces a contradictory self-perception but does not by itself indicate a distortion. The core distortion is in how the person labels themselves as a consistent failure based on some experiences.",Overgeneralization
205,"People’s internal actions and reactions are so dull, slow, foolish, and I cannot say anything because they won’t be able to understand my words, and I know exactly why.","People’s internal actions and reactions are so dull, slow, foolish; I cannot say anything because they won’t be able to understand my words; I know exactly why.","The statement contains a negative global judgment about others’ internal actions and reactions ('dull, slow, foolish'), which is indicative of labeling—assigning a fixed, negative label to people. Additionally, the speaker assumes others 'won’t be able to understand my words' and claims to 'know exactly why,' which suggests an assumption of others' thoughts without evidence, characteristic of mind reading. However, the strongest cognitive distortion here is the labeling of people as 'dull, slow, foolish', which is a direct and clear example of labeling rather than the inferred thoughts about others' understanding. The assumption about others' comprehension aligns secondarily with mind reading but is less central than the explicit negative labeling.",Labeling
206,"I just feel that if they could die peacefully, it would be best for their victims.","""if they could die peacefully, it would be best for their victims""","The statement involves the speaker making a judgment about the outcome being 'best for their victims' based on a hypothetical event ('if they could die peacefully'). This reflects a prediction about the future and an interpretation of others' experiences contingent on an event that hasn't occurred yet. The speaker is essentially forecasting the consequences of a possible event, which is characteristic of fortune-telling. There is no indication of absolutist terms (all-or-nothing), emotional justification (emotional reasoning), or general negative labeling. The focus is on predicting a future scenario and its impact, fitting the definition of fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

This suggests the speaker is attributing a particular negative and unfair behavior specifically to themselves in relation to S's actions. The focus on the speaker's personal actions and S's responses points to a distortion where the speaker is personalizing the situation, assuming that forgiveness patterns are targeted or specific to them rather than viewing the dynamic more neutrally or considering other factors. The statement does not indicate an all-or-nothing mindset, mind reading without evidence, emotional reasoning, or other distortions as strongly as personalization.",Personalization
208,one moment he would say he was committed to trying and the next I wasn’t right for him.,one moment he would say he was committed to trying and the next I wasn’t right for him,"The statement highlights a perception of inconsistency in another person's feelings or actions. The speaker notes a sudden shift from commitment to rejection without an apparent middle ground. This reflects viewing the situation in two mutually exclusive categories (committed vs. not right), without acknowledging any nuance or possibility of complexity in the relationship dynamics. This black-and-white view fits the cognitive distortion known as All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The phrase 'your life is worthless because of how you look' indicates internalized negative labeling. The phrase 'PEOPLE will not get any better either' generalizes from personal experience to all people, reflecting Overgeneralization. However, the dominant distortion is the prediction that no therapist or therapy will help ('no amount of therapy... could convince me that it will ever get any better'), which fits Fortune-telling best. The negative future outcome is assumed with certainty despite the lack of proof, which drives the belief to avoid therapy.",Fortune-telling

The phrase ‘everyone (all twice my age or more) pick apart...’ generalizes the behavior to a whole group. This suggests the person is making a broad conclusion based on these experiences. This is characteristic of overgeneralization, where a single or few events are seen as an ongoing, widespread pattern. Other distortions like mind reading could be relevant, but the emphasis on frequency and generalization to many people points primarily to overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

This reflects an assumption about a future event without evidence, which fits the 'Fortune-telling' distortion. It is not all-or-nothing thinking since the speaker is uncertain ('I don’t know'), not labeling others or themselves, not magnifying or filtering information, nor applying emotional reasoning or personalization.",Fortune-telling

The desire to confront the issue 'so I never have the issue again' implies a hope for a definitive resolution that completely eradicates the problem. This wording suggests an 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' distortion, as it frames the solution in absolute terms—either fully confront and permanently eliminate the issue, or continue suffering.

This represents a broad conclusion about themselves based on limited evidence and changes over time. The key element is the generalization of the trait to being the dominant characteristic, which goes beyond the specific instances and implies an overarching personal trait defined by this change.

The individual is experiencing persistent, anxiety-fueled concerns that negatively impact their emotional state, fitting patterns of obsessive doubt and intrusive thoughts rather than clear evidence or reality. This fits the profile of a cognitive distortion where feelings (emotional reasoning) dictate belief ('I must be a pedophile because I feel worried and consumed by this'), rather than objective facts (no desire or action). The worry is not based on actual behavior but on emotional distress, which is common in emotional reasoning. Other distortions like labeling or fortune-telling do not fit as well because the concern is not a self-label or a prediction, but rather a belief based on emotional states.",Emotional Reasoning

This is a prediction made without certainty, assuming the worst possible outcome. The speaker is imagining a catastrophic future event based on their cultural and religious context without direct evidence that this will happen. This fits the pattern of 'Fortune-telling,' where one assumes negative future events with certainty. The emotional distress and actions described support the intensity but do not alter the cognitive distortion type. The content is not an all-or-nothing scenario nor labeling or personalization, but a clear example of predicting a negative future outcome.",Fortune-telling

I get how me complaining makes him feel inadequate, so it’s a vicious cycle id like to break.","feel anxious, inadequate, not good enough for him; me complaining makes him feel inadequate; vicious cycle I'd like to break","The speaker expresses feelings of inadequacy and anxiety about their impact on another person. They recognize that their complaining causes the other person to feel inadequate, which feeds back into their own feelings, creating a 'vicious cycle.' This indicates they are attributing responsibility for the other's feelings to themselves. The focus on how their behavior causes the other's emotional state reflects personalization—taking excessive responsibility for others' feelings or events.

The phrase 'every boyfriend' generalizes the behavior across all instances without exception. This is indicative of overgeneralization, where a single or multiple instances are extended to an absolute claim covering all cases. There is no evidence of other distortion types like labeling (which would involve naming oneself or others negatively), emotional reasoning (which would involve basing facts on feelings), or fortune-telling (predicting a future event). Thus, the best fit is overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

Additionally, the speaker feels the other person is the sole cause of their pain, implying a personal blame focus. However, the key cognitive distortion here is that the speaker assumes they know the other person's thoughts or beliefs ('she thinks...'), which points toward Mind Reading.",Mind Reading
247,I don’t think my mom feels safe either.,my mom feels safe,"The statement assumes knowledge of another person's feelings without direct evidence, concluding that 'my mom feels safe' in a negative sense.

This implies a shift from seeing similarity to focusing on differences, but it does not present an extreme or absolute judgment (e.g., saying 'we have nothing in common' or 'she is completely different'). Instead, it highlights a nuanced observation of changing dynamics without jumping to an extreme or labeling the friend negatively. There is no evidence of distorting the situation by filtering out all positives or blowing negative aspects out of proportion. Also, it does not suggest an emotional misinterpretation, predictive error, or overgeneralization from one specific example.",No Distortion

The individual is predicting a negative outcome ('what I might do') that could happen if the family continues to be non-supportive. This reflects a form of prediction without concrete evidence, focusing on a potentially negative future, which matches the pattern of 'Fortune-telling'. The statement does not show all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or personalization directly. Although fear is an emotion, it is tied to a forecast about the future rather than reasoning solely from emotion, so it is not 'Emotional Reasoning'.",Fortune-telling

This implies the speaker is taking personal responsibility for the abuser's actions, which is classic personalization—attributing external negative events to oneself without sufficient evidence. There is no clear indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or labeling, as the focus is on self-blame leading to perceived justification of abuse.",Personalization

This matches the definition of Mind Reading, where one assumes they know others' thoughts or feelings. The first part ""I can’t stand when she comes around"" expresses strong negative emotion but does not indicate a distortion on its own. Therefore, the key distortion present is Mind Reading.",Mind Reading

They express resentment toward the relationship for limiting their willingness to work overtime, which impacts goal achievement.

This suggests the speaker is assuming or inferring the thoughts or feelings of others (mind reading). Additionally, the statement includes an emotional reaction that influences their belief ('I can't shake the urge to give up'), which could indicate emotional reasoning.

255,There are some times we’re I also feel like I’m dreaming constantly.,"there are some times, I also feel like I’m dreaming constantly","The statement contains the phrase 'some times' indicating that the feeling of 'dreaming constantly' is not absolute but occurs occasionally. This suggests a generalization from some instances to a broader perception or feeling. The sense of 'dreaming constantly' may reflect a perception that these experiences are pervasive. The key cognitive distortion at play here is 'Overgeneralization' because the person is inferring a persistent state ('constantly') from some instances ('some times'), thereby applying a limited experience to a wider or more enduring context than justified.",Overgeneralization
256,"I’m at a loss, she’s gonna ruin her life again for an ex.","""she’s gonna ruin her life again for an ex""","The phrase predicts a negative outcome (ruining her life) as a certainty about what the person will do, which has not yet happened.

This suggests a clear cutoff in experience: everything before age seven was happy, and everything after was problematic. This pattern reflects black-and-white thinking, where experiences are seen in absolutes with no middle ground or nuance.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
258,"I know that’s unhealthy, but I don’t seem to be fufilled from positive attention only.","I know that’s unhealthy, but I don’t seem to be fulfilled from positive attention only.","The statement expresses an awareness ('I know that’s unhealthy') but simultaneously justifies behavior or feelings that arise despite that knowledge. The key idea is that the speaker is reasoning based on their emotional experience—feeling unfulfilled despite positive attention. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where feelings and emotions are used as evidence for reality or truth ('I don’t seem to be fulfilled from positive attention only'). There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions here. The focus is the reliance on emotional state to justify a belief.",Emotional Reasoning
259,I used to think its normal but now in not so sure.,I used to think it's normal but now I'm not so sure,"The statement reflects a shift in belief about a situation's normality. The speaker initially accepted something as normal but now doubts it. This does not indicate an absolute all-or-nothing perspective, nor is it jumping to conclusions about the future (fortune-telling) or labeling. It also does not assume others' thoughts (mind reading), nor does it reflect extreme magnification or filtering of negative details exclusively. The key here is uncertainty and re-evaluation rather than distortion. The statement does not clearly match cognitive distortions like emotional reasoning or personalization either. Therefore, this statement likely involves no cognitive distortion, simply an honest reassessment.",No Distortion
260,I really feel like I’m on the edge from just going insane because I feel helpless/hopeless.,"I really feel like I’m on the edge from just going insane, I feel helpless, I feel hopeless","The statement bases the conclusion ('I’m on the edge of going insane') on the emotional feelings of helplessness and hopelessness.

The person recognizes that some triggers are insignificant ('things that I shouldn’t be getting mad over') but still reacts strongly. This indicates an emotional amplification of small negative events, fitting the definition of Magnification, where a person exaggerates the importance or seriousness of events.",Magnification

This aligns with Fortune-telling, a distortion where one assumes or predicts negative future events despite lack of certainty. The disappointment with results indicates a negative emotional response but does not qualify as other distortions like All-or-Nothing or Overgeneralization since no absolute terms or broad conclusions are made. Therefore, the primary distortion is predicting a negative future outcome based on current feelings and results.",Fortune-telling
265,"I’ve always noticed that if she can’t see something, she doesn’t believe in it.","if she can’t see something, she doesn’t believe in it","The statement assumes the other person's belief system solely depends on their ability to see something.

The key phrase 'I am always being told that I am good for nothing' reflects internalizing negative labels assigned by others, which is indicative of 'Labeling'. The statement 'I should probably kill myself' derives from this internalized negative judgment and perceived failure. There is no evidence that the person is basing this on emotions alone (emotional reasoning), nor predicting future events (fortune-telling), or filtering specific facts while ignoring others (mental filter). The prominent cognitive distortion is internalizing and accepting harsh negative labels about oneself, hence 'Labeling'.",Labeling
267,"And I feel as though she simply can’t grasp the fact that, I at least care about her.",she simply can’t grasp the fact that I care about her,"The statement assumes knowledge of the other person's thoughts or feelings without direct evidence.

This is characteristic of Mind Reading, where one presumes to know another's mental state.",Mind Reading
268,He has been fighting with my dad about every little thing.,"""fighting with my dad about every little thing""","The phrase ""every little thing"" suggests that the speaker is generalizing the behavior of fighting to all interactions regardless of context or significance.

Hence, the statement reflects a cognitive distortion where a specific set of incidents is exaggerated to represent a consistent pattern.",Overgeneralization

The individual attributes their present fear entirely to their past behavior, indicating an internal, personalized cause for their emotional state. This reflects taking responsibility or blaming oneself for something that may not fully be under their control, which aligns with the distortion of Personalization.

271,my family always tries to tell me WHY i shouldnt feel a certain way and it makes it worse.,my family always tries to tell me WHY i shouldnt feel a certain way and it makes it worse,"The key phrase 'my family always tries to tell me WHY i shouldnt feel a certain way' suggests the speaker perceives the family as invalidating their emotions. The phrase 'and it makes it worse' indicates the speaker is interpreting the situation through their emotional state, believing that because they feel worse, the external invalidation is inherently harmful. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the person assumes that their emotional response accurately reflects reality, i.e., 'I feel worse, so what they're doing must be wrong or harmful.' The other distortions are less relevant: it's not All-or-Nothing (no absolute terms about self or others), not Fortune-telling (not predicting the future), not Labeling (no negative labels on self or others), not Magnification (no exaggeration), no Mental filter (no selective focus), no Mind Reading (not assuming thoughts of others without evidence), no Personalization (not blaming self), no Should statements (no 'should' or 'must').",Emotional Reasoning

This suggests the person is drawing a conclusion based on their feelings and distrust rather than objective evidence. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where emotions are taken as proof of truth (i.e., feeling untrustworthy and doubting one's own illness equates to actually not having it). There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling about future events, labeling, magnification, mental filter, mind reading, overgeneralization, personalization, or should statements.

It assumes a causal relationship without evidence, implying the person's actions are directly due to the pills. This reflects a form of guessing someone's behavior or motivation without clear proof.

The expression 'I am stuck in a constant state of anxiety' reflects a perception that the emotional state is unchanging and overwhelming, which is an interpretation based on feelings rather than objective evidence. Additionally, 'can’t find anyone to see me anytime soon' reflects helpless anticipation about obtaining support. Among the cognitive distortions, the key feature involves basing the judgement of reality (the worsening situation) largely on emotional state ('so much worse', 'constant anxiety'), which is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning—assuming that because one feels badly about the situation, it must be objectively bad. The other distortions are less fitting: No clear black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing) or labeling; no specific fortune-telling prediction; no selective mental filtering explicitly stated; no personalization or should-statements evident; mind reading or overgeneralization are less emphasized here.",Emotional Reasoning

This is a clear example of assuming or predicting a specific negative event without concrete evidence. They are foretelling an outcome as inevitable, which is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling'. The fear is based on an anticipated event rather than current facts or feelings alone, so it is not Emotional Reasoning or Mind Reading. The wording 'will always end up finding me' also suggests a prediction about the future rather than a present state or an internal label.",Fortune-telling

The discomfort emerges from the perceived meaning of the therapist’s pose (legs open, sitting opposite) and her statement about giving her heart feelings. The speaker is using their emotional reaction ('I felt uncomfortable') as evidence to judge the situation rather than considering other perspectives or facts. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as proof of reality.",Emotional Reasoning
292,"I felt betrayed, lonely, boring and flat to him.   I questioned our relationship everyday and it gave me anxiety.","""I felt betrayed, lonely, boring and flat to him""; ""I questioned our relationship everyday""; ""it gave me anxiety""","The statement involves the person attributing negative feelings (betrayed, lonely, boring, flat) to themselves and interpreting the partner's thoughts or feelings without direct evidence. Specifically, the phrase ""boring and flat to him"" implies the speaker is assuming they are perceived negatively by the partner. Furthermore, ""I questioned our relationship everyday"" suggests ongoing negative anticipation. This aligns closely with 'Mind Reading,' where one assumes they know what others are thinking or feeling without verification.",Mind Reading

There is no indication that they are assuming a certain negative outcome or catastrophizing future events (so not Fortune-telling or Magnification). The focus is on their emotional discomfort with the thought rather than a cognitive error like all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or mind reading. Since they base their perspective on an emotional response ('I hate thinking about...') rather than objective facts, this aligns with Emotional Reasoning—believing their feelings reflect truth or reality.",Emotional Reasoning

The part expressing expectation about the ability to recognize the situation means the person is holding themselves to a rigid standard (“I should be able to…”), which directly reflects a 'Should statement' distortion. While there are elements of emotional reasoning (feeling responsible makes it true), the predominant distortion is the imposition of a strict 'should' standard on oneself, highlighting 'Should statements' as the key cognitive distortion.",Should statements
295,It feels like he’s fighting as hard as he can to avoid letting go completely.,It feels like he’s fighting as hard as he can to avoid letting go completely.,"The statement interprets the person's internal effort or struggle without direct evidence, presuming knowledge of the other person's mental or emotional state. This fits the definition of Mind Reading, where one assumes they know what another person is thinking or feeling without confirmation. The phrase ""It feels like"" signals an inferred belief about the other’s intentions or efforts, not a definitive fact.",Mind Reading

More importantly, the statement includes a belief about the mother's intentions ('some kind of trap being set... in hopes of getting full custody') without evidence. This belief assumes the mother's motives negatively without concrete proof, which aligns with predicting a negative outcome or reasoning about intentions without direct knowledge. This fits with 'Fortune-telling' because the speaker is predicting future negative events based on current perceptions. It is not 'Mind Reading' because the belief is about intentions or plans rather than thoughts or feelings. There is no indication of exaggeration, all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or personalization beyond this predictive aspect.",Fortune-telling

This is an interpretation of the fiancé's thoughts or feelings, reflecting an attempt to 'read the mind' of another person. The statement also includes ongoing doubts based on certain behaviors, but the primary distortion is assuming knowledge of the fiancé's attraction purely through feelings and suspicion. There is no clear indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or other distortions listed. The core distortion is 'Mind Reading' because the speaker assumes to know the fiancé's internal motivations without explicit communication or evidence.",Mind Reading

It reflects a recognition of personal faults based on emotional states, suggesting acceptance rather than distortion. There is no indication of cognitive distortion such as exaggerating the impact (Magnification), seeing everything as black-or-white (All-or-Nothing Thinking), presuming others’ thoughts (Mind Reading), or absolute negative labeling.

This reflects an overgeneralization where one negative experience or feeling is extended broadly to one's abilities and self-worth, rather than seeing it as a temporary or specific issue.",Overgeneralization

There is no clear evidence of black-and-white thinking, negative labeling, prediction of future events, or assuming others’ thoughts. Instead, it reflects a neutral or curious re-evaluation of a past event's potential impact without emotional distortion or bias. Therefore, the statement does not demonstrate a cognitive distortion but a reasonable reflection.",No Distortion

I thought it was my fault.,parents were mad at me; somehow an 11 year old was supposed to know what to do; I thought it was my fault,"The statement shows the individual blaming themselves for the parents being mad, despite acknowledging the unrealistic expectation that an 11-year-old should know what to do. The key aspect is the belief that their fault caused the parents' anger, reflecting taking responsibility for something that may not be legitimately theirs to hold. This reflects personalization, where the person attributes external events or others' emotions to themselves without sufficient justification.",Personalization

This reflects a tendency to label oneself with broad, global terms rather than more nuanced descriptions. The speaker is applying simple, binary labels to complex traits. This is characteristic of the 'Labeling' distortion, where a person assigns a fixed, negative or positive label to themselves or others based on specific behaviors or traits. The presence of contrasting labels shows confusion or complexity but the use of definitive labels is central.",Labeling

This suggests a lack of nuance in their thinking, viewing the ability to control the behavior as either complete short-term success or immediate failure afterward, without considering partial progress or different timeframes.

Although there is mention of repeated negative patterns, the core distortion is in the global negative identity label rather than all-or-nothing thinking or overgeneralization.

The statement reflects an internalization of this expectation, where the speaker is acknowledging their current challenging circumstances (lack of car, variable sleep schedule, signs of agoraphobia) but is implicitly judged against the expectation. The use of ""need to"" aligns with the cognitive distortion known as ""Should statements,"" where a person imposes rigid rules or expectations on themselves or others. This creates pressure and potentially negative self-judgment for not meeting these standards.

This indicates an exaggerated perception of the impact of these events. The focus on small inconveniences causing major upset suggests an amplification of negative aspects, which aligns with the distortion of magnification. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or predicting the future, nor evidence of filtering or mind reading. Emotional reasoning could be a consideration, but the emphasis is more on exaggerating the significance of events rather than concluding truth solely based on feelings.

It then concludes with an absolute characterization that 'he could never control his anger.' This indicates an extreme, black-and-white interpretation without acknowledging any exceptions or nuances.

The statement 'I cannot overcome this feeling' suggests that the emotions are being taken as evidence of the situation's reality, rather than just feelings. The distress caused by hearing comments further emphasizes that their emotions are driving their perception and behavior, showing emotional reasoning rather than a cognitive distortion involving assumptions about the external world or self-labeling.",Emotional Reasoning

The individual predicts a negative outcome (doing something bad) based on their feelings of losing control. This is indicative of predicting a future event (something bad happening) without concrete proof, aligning with the distortion known as Fortune-telling. The key difference from Emotional Reasoning is that the person is not concluding that something is true because they feel it, but rather predicting a negative future event based on their fears and urges.

This suggests the person is not blaming themselves excessively but is noticing a situational cause for their reactions. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, mind reading, or fortune-telling. Instead, the focus is on the presence of triggers leading to specific emotional reactions. Since the person is describing real emotional responses to external stimuli, not interpreting feelings as facts or distorting the causes unrealistically, the statement does not contain a cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as facts.",Emotional Reasoning
335,I’m very bold in my expression I am calm but usually I will be insulting and ask them why they did it. I’m usually quite the ass and wish them the worst luck in life. Simply because I believe that everyone should show some remorse for being rotten.,I’m usually quite the ass and wish them the worst luck in life; everyone should show some remorse for being rotten.,"The speaker expresses a belief that others ought to feel remorse for their bad behavior ('everyone should show some remorse for being rotten'), which fits the 'Should statements' distortion. They hold a rigid expectation of how people should behave, leading to negative feelings when those expectations are unmet. While there is some labeling ('quite the ass'), the core distortion lies in the 'should' belief driving their emotional response.",Should statements
336,"I tend to feel like im somehow not in control of my thoughts at all, its one thought after another sometimes with no connection at all I doubt myself so much, ill constantly think that what I feel is wrong and I shouldn’t even feel or think the way I do but I cant stop it.  I cant hold a job because I have extremely bad anxiety.","I doubt myself so much, I'll constantly think that what I feel is wrong and I shouldn’t even feel or think the way I do, but I can't stop it.","The individual expresses persistent self-doubt and harsh judgment about their own thoughts and feelings, indicating an internal rule or belief about how they 'should' feel or think. This reflects the use of 'should statements,' where a person imposes rigid and critical standards on themselves, leading to emotional distress. Other parts of the statement (feeling out of control, anxiety impacting job) are more descriptive of symptoms rather than other distortions like fortune-telling or emotional reasoning. The key distortion lies in the explicit 'I shouldn’t even feel or think the way I do' phrasing, which matches the 'Should statements' distortion.",Should statements

The fear about the lack of evidence and the negative outcome is a prediction without certainty—it assumes a negative future outcome (that the perpetrator will not be found or convicted). This aligns with Fortune-telling, where one predicts negative results without sufficient evidence.",Fortune-telling

It shows a tendency to label them negatively and permanently. Although the narrator expresses frustration and describes various issues, they focus primarily on these negative character labels without acknowledging any complexity or positive traits. The cognitive distortion evident here is 'Labeling', where complex individuals are reduced to a single negative trait or label.",Labeling
339,"I think they’re lying, but have no idea why.","I think they’re lying, but have no idea why","The person assumes that others are lying without having any concrete evidence or reason to justify this belief.

340,I realized that I don’t really care at all about things I should care about.,I don’t really care at all about things I should care about,"The statement uses 'should' to set expectations about what the speaker believes they are supposed to care about, implying a normative requirement. The use of 'should care about' fits the pattern of 'Should statements,' where the individual imposes rigid rules or expectations on their own behavior or feelings. This is not an all-or-nothing view, nor is it emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, or any of the other distortions listed. The core distortion is the internal demand or criticism inherent in 'should' which characterizes the 'Should statements' distortion.",Should statements

The statement ""I’m scared he’s going to react"" indicates anticipating a negative reaction without confirmation. This reflects assuming a negative outcome ahead of time. Therefore, the cognitive distortion involved is predicting future events negatively without proof, which is characteristic of Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
343,The girl is impossible! She is selfish and is incapable of thinking about someone other than herself.

This reflects a tendency to assign a global negative label to the girl based on perceived flaws. The phrase 'she is incapable of thinking about someone other than herself' further reinforces this negative labeling. Additionally, the use of 'should' in 'she is old enough to take responsibility' indicates expectations about how she ought to behave. The main distortion appears to be Labeling because the speaker is attaching a fixed negative identity ('impossible,' 'selfish') to the girl. There is also a presence of Should Statements, but since the crux is in the sweeping negative character judgment, Labeling is more appropriate as the single classification.",Labeling
344,She competes with me.,"""She competes with me.""","The statement assumes the other person's intentions or thoughts without explicit evidence, implying that 'she' has a competitive attitude towards the speaker.

345,When I’m doing a task I feel like a complete moron.,I feel like a complete moron,"The phrase 'I feel like a complete moron' involves assigning a negative, global label to oneself based on feelings or perceived performance in a task. This is a clear example of labeling, where the individual internally categorizes themselves negatively rather than focusing on specific behaviors or situations. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or other distortions here; the statement is about assigning a fixed negative label to oneself.",Labeling

This reflects a cognitive distortion where a single event is seen as the definitive reason for many different problems without sufficient evidence. The individual is making a causal connection that may not be justified, pointing to an overarching explanation for diverse negative experiences. This pattern resembles Overgeneralization, where one event or possibility is seen as the cause or explanation for many unrelated outcomes.",Overgeneralization
347,"I’ve been worried about bringing this up with a psychologist because I am a mother I’m worried they will call CPS on me.

Additionally, the speaker compares themselves to others' maternal instincts and concludes they lack this need, implying a rigid interpretation of their feelings. The predominant distortion here is the assumption about a negative future event (being reported to CPS) based on fear rather than fact, which best fits 'Fortune-telling'. There is also a hint of 'Emotional Reasoning' in equating their feelings with objective truth, but the fear of CPS reporting is the primary distortion.",Fortune-telling

This suggests a distorted perception of self-ability, which can be a form of cognitive distortion. The given example shows a sudden, uncharacteristic behavior not aligned with previous self-assessment, pointing to an inaccurate internal evaluation rather than rational assessment. Among the listed distortions, none directly matches 'false beliefs about capabilities,' but labeling involves assigning inaccurate or exaggerated labels to oneself or others. The statement describes the person having false ideas about his own abilities, fitting closest to 'Labeling' as it deals with self-identity and self-assessment errors.",Labeling

They also assume that their hard work would be exploited by others ('free-loaders riding coattails'), implying an anticipated negative outcome without clear proof, which aligns partly with Fortune-telling. However, the primary distortion is relying heavily on feelings to make a broad judgment about worth and outcomes, rather than logical evaluation, which is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
350,I am sure if we lived together it would be easier but we dont.,I am sure if we lived together it would be easier but we dont.,"The statement expresses certainty about a future scenario improving the situation (living together would make it easier) despite insufficient evidence. The speaker is predicting an outcome with confidence, which aligns with making assumptions about the future. This fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling' as it involves predicting a future event negatively or positively without concrete proof. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, magnification, or other distortions present here.",Fortune-telling
351,"I was wondering if the girl, now about 12 years old, is now showing aggressive behaviors did she learn it from her sibling?",wondering if the girl is showing aggressive behaviors and if she learned it from her sibling,"The sentence expresses a speculation about future or current behavior ('is now showing aggressive behaviors') and a cause for it ('did she learn it from her sibling') without having concrete evidence. This indicates predicting behavior or outcomes without certainty, which aligns with the cognitive distortion of 'Fortune-telling.' The statement is not an emotional inference or a broad generalization, but a specific conjecture about the girl's behavior and the cause based on incomplete information.",Fortune-telling
352,"I have never told anyone what happened all those years ago, for fear that I am over exaggerating the seriousness of what happened.","I have never told anyone what happened all those years ago, for fear that I am over exaggerating the seriousness of what happened.","The key phrase indicates a fear based on an assumption about one's own perception being exaggerated. This reflects a worry or prediction about how serious the event is perceived by oneself or others, without evidence. The person anticipates an exaggerated appraisal of the situation. This aligns with 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts negative outcomes or reactions without direct evidence.",Fortune-telling
353,He never accepts responsibility for anything.,"""He never accepts responsibility for anything.""","The statement uses the word ""never"" which implies an absolute, sweeping conclusion about the person's behavior. This overgeneralizes from potentially limited instances to all possible situations, assuming a consistent and complete pattern without exception. This is characteristic of the cognitive distortion known as Overgeneralization, where one negative instance or limited experience is applied broadly.",Overgeneralization
354,"Even though mentally it was probably all not good for me, it was the most amazing thing ever, and I liked him so much.","Even though mentally it was probably all not good for me, it was the most amazing thing ever, and I liked him so much.","The statement contrasts a negative belief about the experience ('probably all not good for me') with a highly positive emotional evaluation ('the most amazing thing ever') and strong liking for someone. The speaker acknowledges that mentally the situation was harmful but emphasizes the overwhelmingly positive emotional experience. This suggests reliance on feelings to judge reality, specifically using emotional experience ('liked him so much' and 'most amazing thing') as evidence that the situation was good despite evidence to the contrary. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are treated as proof of truth regardless of objective facts.",Emotional Reasoning

Probably.,"""Should I be held to the standard of faith persevering through childhood regardless of my situational experiences""; ""Probably.""","The key phrase involves the word ""Should,"" indicating an expectation or rule the speaker feels they are being held to. This reflects the cognitive distortion where individuals impose strict and rigid rules or standards upon themselves or others. The phrase ""Probably"" suggests tentative acceptance of this expectation, reinforcing the sense of obligation implied by ""should."" The focus is on perceived duties or ethical demands rather than distorted interpretations of events or people, ruling out other distortions like mind reading or overgeneralization.",Should statements

This indicates making a broad generalization based on some observations of their emotional reactions. The use of 'almost always' suggests an overgeneralization, as it extends a specific pattern to nearly all situations without sufficient evidence. There is no indication of thinking in strictly black-and-white terms (All-or-Nothing), interpreting feelings as facts (Emotional Reasoning), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), assigning labels to self or others (Labeling), exaggerating importance (Magnification), filtering out positives (Mental filter), assuming others’ thoughts (Mind Reading), personalizing unrelated events (Personalization), or using 'should' statements.",Overgeneralization

This involves assuming that others' opinions are negative without concrete evidence. The shame felt after crying suggests emotional reasoning (feeling ashamed equates to being weak) and possibly mind reading (assuming others think the speaker is weak). However, the dominant distortion is the belief about how others will react to the speaker's emotions, which aligns most closely with mind reading—the assumption of knowing what others think and feel about one's actions.",Mind Reading
358,I let him push me sexually and push my boundaries.,"""I let him push me sexually""; ""push my boundaries""","The statement places responsibility on the speaker using the phrase 'I let him,' implying self-blame or personal fault for another person's actions.

The speaker is personalizing the situation, feeling they allowed or caused the behavior rather than seeing the other person's agency distinctly.",Personalization

The key distortion lies in attributing personal responsibility or blame for something that may not be within their control, influenced by external judgment. This indicates 'Personalization,' as the individual is internalizing responsibility or blame without clear evidence that they are at fault.",Personalization

362,"I’m assuming this begun at a much younger age than now, such as when I was probably ten or maybe eleven.","I’m assuming this begun at a much younger age than now, such as when I was probably ten or maybe eleven.","The key phrase here is 'I’m assuming' combined with specifying an approximate earlier age without concrete evidence. This indicates making a conclusion about the timing of an event based on speculation about the past. The person is predicting or inferring something about an unknown past situation without factual confirmation, which aligns with a form of 'fortune-telling'—although typically fortune-telling refers to predicting the future, the cognitive distortion can sometimes apply to assumptions about past or future without verification. Other distortions like 'mind reading' or 'personalization' do not fit because the assumption is about a temporal fact, not about others' thoughts or assigning personal blame. There is no all-or-nothing language, labeling, or magnification present. Therefore, the best fit is 'Fortune-telling' as the person is assuming how things began without evidence.",Fortune-telling
363,I’ve always wondered if doing this means there’s something wrong with me.,‘doing this means there’s something wrong with me’,"The statement involves assuming that performing a certain action directly indicates a negative personal flaw.

Do you think I may have ADHD?,"""I stress myself out and beat myself up for it on a daily basis""; ""to the point that I exert more energy fighting with myself to fold the laundry than it would take to fold the laundry""","The statement highlights a pattern where the speaker engages in harsh self-criticism (""beat myself up"") repeatedly (""on a daily basis"") for being unorganized and messy. This reflects labeling themselves negatively based on perceived shortcomings. The focus on self-criticism instead of the actual task suggests a negative global label rather than a balanced assessment. The mention of exerting more energy fighting internally than completing the task underscores the internalized negative self-judgment. While there is some element of magnification in perceiving the struggle as greater internally, the primary distortion is labeling, as the core issue is the negative global self-assessment rather than exaggeration or other distortions.",Labeling

This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are treated as facts. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions. The statement reports a perception of imbalance but does not overgeneralize or personalize beyond the immediate situation. Hence, Emotional Reasoning best fits the statement.",Emotional Reasoning

This reflects an internal attribution of feelings disconnected from the partner's actual behavior. It is not about all-or-nothing thinking or fortune-telling, as the focus isn’t on absolute outcomes or predictions but on an emotional response that is contradictory to the external reality. The individual appears to be personalizing their feelings, suggesting that their emotional reaction is solely based on their own internal processes rather than partner’s actions. This is a form of 'Personalization' where the person internalizes the relationship dynamics emotionally, assigning blame or causation to themselves or their own feelings disconnected from external reasons.",Personalization

369,I realized I talk to myself out loud way too much.,I talk to myself out loud way too much,"The phrase 'way too much' indicates the person believes they engage in the behavior excessively. This suggests an exaggeration without clear evidence of frequency or impact. It seems to generalize the behavior beyond what might be objectively true, potentially making it an overgeneralization. However, there is no indication of absolute terms (all-or-nothing), no forecasting future outcomes (fortune-telling), or making judgments about self-worth (labeling). The statement is most closely aligned with overgeneralization since it implies a global statement about the frequency of the behavior.",Overgeneralization
370,But since I trusted my mom these comments did stick with me and made me feel unsure and unsafe.,trusted my mom; comments did stick with me; made me feel unsure and unsafe,"The statement indicates that because the speaker trusted their mom, the comments had a significant emotional impact, causing feelings of being unsure and unsafe. This reflects relying on feelings as evidence for reality (feeling unsafe = assumed reality), which aligns with Emotional Reasoning. There is no evidence of absolute thinking, predicting the future, labeling, or overgeneralizing here. The key distortion is using emotions to interpret the situation rather than objective evidence.",Emotional Reasoning

What I mean by this is that you’re either “perfect” or a “failure”.,I see behavior in black and white terms; you’re either “perfect” or a “failure”.,"The statement explicitly describes viewing behavior in extreme categories without any middle ground — categorizing people strictly as 'perfect' or 'failure'. This binary thinking pattern is characterized by seeing situations in absolutes, typical of All-or-Nothing Thinking. Other distortions such as Labeling involve attaching negative labels, but this example is more about the dichotomous evaluation rather than a single label. Thus, the key feature aligns best with All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

I felt like I have missed so much of the college experience and have such little freedom compared to everyone else my age.",felt like I have missed so much of the college experience; have such little freedom compared to everyone else my age,"The statement suggests a feeling of having missed a significant portion of a common experience (college life) and a perception of having much less freedom relative to peers. This reflects a broad conclusion drawn from personal circumstances over a long period (3 1/2 years) and compares oneself unfavorably to others, implying a generalized negative belief about one's situation. The key is the broad generalization about missing out and lacking freedom, rather than focusing on specific events or evidence. Therefore, this matches the cognitive distortion of Overgeneralization, where a single or limited experience is seen as a never-ending pattern.",Overgeneralization

After acquiring new information about the difference between internal thoughts and hearing voices, their emotional response becomes heightened concern.

381,"She never respects my privacy and constantly condescends me, especially in front of other family members.","""never respects my privacy"", ""constantly condescends me"", ""especially in front of other family members""","The key phrase 'never respects my privacy' indicates a perception that the other person always disrespects privacy without exception. The word 'never' suggests an absolute, all-encompassing judgment about the behavior. This reflects 'All-or-Nothing Thinking,' where situations are seen in black-or-white terms with no middle ground. There is no indication here of assuming to know the person's thoughts (Mind Reading), nor focusing on a single negative detail (Mental filter), nor predicting the future (Fortune-telling). Hence, the distortion aligns most closely with All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
382,I want to be with her but I can’t keep myself in check.  I’m feeling worthless and guilty.,"""I can’t keep myself in check"", ""I’m feeling worthless"", ""I’m feeling guilty""","The speaker expresses negative emotions about themselves ('worthless' and 'guilty') based on internal feelings rather than objective evidence.

They are drawing a conclusion about the nature of emotions based on the emotional context they witnessed, rather than on objective facts. This reflects reasoning based on feelings rather than facts. The speaker's perception of emotions being negative is grounded in their emotional experience of family conflict, which points to 'Emotional Reasoning'—believing something is true because they feel it strongly, rather than because it is objectively true.",Emotional Reasoning
384,"After over 10 years of marriage and 3 children, I’m now wondering if my husband is also a narcissist and emotionally abusing me because many things he does are just like what my parent did.",wondering if my husband is also a narcissist and emotionally abusing me because many things he does are just like what my parent did,"The key phrase indicates the person is inferring that their husband is a narcissist and emotionally abusive based on similarities to the parent’s behavior. This involves jumping to a specific negative conclusion about the husband’s character without sufficient evidence, based primarily on resemblance to past experience. This aligns with the distortion type 'Labeling', where a person assigns a fixed, negative label to someone.",Labeling
385,I went to 3 different therapists and left them all because I felt too anxious talking to them.,I went to 3 different therapists and left them all because I felt too anxious talking to them.,"The statement highlights that the person visited multiple therapists but left all of them due to feeling too anxious during the sessions. This suggests the person is drawing a broad conclusion that therapy or therapists in general are not suitable for them based solely on the feeling of anxiety. This is a common pattern of overgeneralization, where one negative experience (or the anxiety felt) is extended to all similar situations (all therapists). It is not emotional reasoning because the anxiety is not presented as evidence of reality, but rather as a cause for leaving all therapists. It is not mind reading since no assumption about others' thoughts is made. No all-or-nothing thinking since the statement does not imply absolute success/failure but implies a generalization. Therefore, the best fit is overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

I hear the slightest noise and I gotta get up and walk all through the house.,scared someone’s going to break in and either kill us all or I’ll get up one morning to one or both kids dead; hear the slightest noise and have to get up and walk all through the house,"The statement involves predicting highly negative events (break-in with killing everyone or waking up to dead kids) without evidence, indicating the person believes these catastrophic outcomes will happen. This aligns with anticipating future events in a negative way, which corresponds to Fortune-telling. The fear triggered by noises and the compulsive checking behavior support this distorted expectation about the future. While there are elements of magnification in exaggerating danger, the core distortion is the prediction of terrible events unfolding.",Fortune-telling

The focus on what one 'should' or 'shouldn't' do is indicative of the 'Should statements' distortion. There is no evidence of other distortions like mind reading or emotional reasoning here, as the person is aware their feelings influence their behavior despite knowing better. Therefore, the cognitive distortion present is 'Should statements.'",Should statements

The phrase ""my mind feels like it’s racing"" is about the person's emotional state rather than an objective fact. The perception that ""no one can catch up to me"" implies an emotional interpretation rather than a logical conclusion. This indicates that the individual is using their emotional state as evidence for how their mind is functioning, which fits the pattern of Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

This prediction of what others will do, particularly in a negative light, aligns with 'Fortune-telling.' The speaker assumes a future event will unfold in a certain way (being dismissed), which impacts their current thinking. While there are elements of emotional distress and possibly mind reading (assuming the therapist's thoughts), the strongest distortion in this statement is the prediction of a negative future event without evidence, which is Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
390,I cannot control my thinking. I feel like a failure.,"""I cannot control my thinking"", ""I feel like a failure""","The phrase ""I feel like a failure"" is a negative self-assessment directly based on an internal feeling rather than concrete evidence. This indicates Emotional Reasoning, where the person believes their negative emotion reflects the truth. The statement ""I cannot control my thinking"" supports this internal feeling but doesn't necessarily imply other distortions such as all-or-nothing or labeling, as the self-judgment is emotion-driven rather than absolute or generalized labeling.",Emotional Reasoning

I know that it’s isn’t true but that thought get repeating in my head.,questioning whether he was real or not; thought keeps repeating; knowing it isn’t true but still scared,"The key element here is the recurring thought questioning the reality of the cousin, which causes fear despite the individual logically knowing it isn’t true. This reflects an emotional state (fear) influencing the perception of reality. The individual is using their feelings of fear as evidence to question reality, which aligns with 'Emotional Reasoning'—believing something is true based on emotional response rather than objective evidence.",Emotional Reasoning
392,"This is about small, non-essential issues, at least to me.","""small, non-essential issues"", ""at least to me""","The statement describes the issues as ""small, non-essential,"" implying a minimization of their importance.

This suggests an emotional-based conclusion (the feeling of distress) driving behavior. There is an implicit assumption that the distressing feeling is an accurate reflection of reality, which fits the pattern of Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as evidence of truth despite external facts.",Emotional Reasoning

395,I’m scared he’ll snap one day and kill me.,he’ll snap one day and kill me,"The sentence predicts a future catastrophic event without evidence, assuming a negative outcome will inevitably happen.

The phrase 'something I should care about' indicates an internal rule or expectation about how the person believes they ought to feel. This fits the pattern of 'Should statements,' where individuals impose rigid rules on themselves about how they or others must behave or feel. Although the person is describing an emotional experience, they are judging themselves against these 'should' expectations rather than distorting facts or making other cognitive errors like magnification or personalization.",Should statements

This suggests a broad and sweeping conclusion about their mental health condition lasting indefinitely. The key phrase 'for as long as I can remember' indicates a generalization across the entire timeframe of their memory, implying the problem never changes or improves. This indicates an overgeneralized pattern of thinking, where a single or limited experience (ongoing depression) is taken as a permanent, unchanging state.",Overgeneralization

They infer qualities about the person (being strange) from their emotional state (feeling unsafe). This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as proof of reality rather than just internal experiences. It is not Fortune-telling because they are not predicting a future event, nor Mind Reading because they do not claim to know what the other is thinking. It also is not Labeling because while they call her strange, the basis is from their feelings, making Emotional Reasoning the core distortion.",Emotional Reasoning
399,I can think about a person all day or a memory and just become so angry and I start thinking of ways to hurt or kill someone.,I can think about a person all day or a memory and just become so angry and I start thinking of ways to hurt or kill someone.,"The statement focuses on the intense, uncontrollable anger triggered by thinking about a person or memory, leading to violent thoughts. This reflects an interpretation of internal emotional states as evidence of reality or truth — the anger experienced leads directly to the contemplation of harmful actions. There is no indication of categorizing situations in extremes (All-or-Nothing), predicting future events (Fortune-telling), or assigning global negative traits (Labeling). Instead, the person equates their emotional experience (anger) as justification or proof of the validity and urgency of their violent thoughts. This aligns with 'Emotional Reasoning', where feelings are used as evidence of reality.",Emotional Reasoning

This involves assuming the other person's thoughts or feelings without direct evidence. The phrase 'doesn’t seem to care' is a key indicator of assuming knowledge about another's internal state. This aligns with Mind Reading, where one infers others' thoughts or feelings without confirmation.",Mind Reading
403,"Ever since then, however, any time I try to relax my mind just replays what happened over and over and I make myself anxious and scared.",my mind just replays what happened over and over; I make myself anxious and scared,"The statement describes a repetitive cycle where the individual’s mind continuously replays a past event, which leads to increased anxiety and fear. This reflects a mental process where the focus is on distressing or negative aspects, filtering out other experiences or more balanced perspectives. The person is stuck on this event and emotionally overwhelmed by it, which fits the pattern of a mental filter distortion—focusing exclusively on negative details and ignoring positive or neutral information.",Mental filter

This reflects a thought process where the feeling or perception is taken as a definite fact without clear evidence, which is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning. The individual relies on their emotional state (feeling they need help) as proof of reality, rather than objective facts. There is no strong indication of other distortions such as fortune-telling or labeling, and the emphasis is on emotional certainty blending with uncertainty about the situation itself.",Emotional Reasoning

However, the key distortion is in the fear that the situation 'is going to get worse' solely based on the lack of insurance. This is a prediction about the future with no certainty, indicating 'Fortune-telling.' The speaker anticipates a negative outcome without evidence, which fits the cognitive distortion of fortune-telling rather than labeling or emotional reasoning.",Fortune-telling
407,"However, this whole issue has been bothering me for so long, and I cannot just get convinced that I was born this way.","this whole issue has been bothering me for so long, and I cannot just get convinced that I was born this way","The statement reflects a persistent emotional response that the issue has been troubling the person for a long time. The phrase 'I cannot just get convinced' points to an emotional state influencing belief, rather than objective evidence. This indicates that the person's feelings (bothered for so long) are driving their conviction ('I cannot just get convinced'), which aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where one assumes that feelings reflect facts.",Emotional Reasoning

This generalization extends over time ('always viewed'), indicating a universalizing pattern. The avoidance behavior during sessions due to embarrassment further supports the impact of this generalized belief. The presence of the word 'always' signifies that the individual believes this applies in all cases without exception, which aligns with overgeneralization rather than situational or emotional reasoning. Therefore, the cognitive distortion involved is overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
409,These thoughts give me horrible anxiety but I’ve never gotten actual mental health.,These thoughts give me horrible anxiety but I’ve never gotten actual mental health.,"The statement links the presence of anxiety-inducing thoughts with the absence of a formal mental health diagnosis.

This reflects emotional reasoning, where emotional experiences are used as evidence for the truth of a situation despite objective facts that might contradict it.",Emotional Reasoning

Additionally, interpreting her behavior as 'pouting' for lack of attention involves assigning a motive without external confirmation, which aligns with mind reading. However, since the emphasis is on the exclusivity ('ONLY') of the seizures' occurrence, the dominant distortion is All-or-Nothing Thinking rather than Mind Reading.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This involves presuming what the other person is thinking or feeling, which aligns with mind reading. There isn't evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, or other distortions as labeled. The key cognitive distortion here is assuming insight into the other person's mental state.",Mind Reading

The speaker is assuming the boyfriend's thoughts or feelings (disrespect) without concrete evidence, basing this assumption on their interpretation of his behavior. This reflects an attempt to 'mind read' the boyfriend's internal state rather than a factual assessment. The key distortion is the belief about what the boyfriend thinks or feels without confirmation, pointing to mind reading.",Mind Reading
414,I confronted both of them but they deny it … now I don’t trust them alone,they deny it … now I don’t trust them alone,"The statement indicates that because 'they deny it,' the speaker has concluded 'now I don’t trust them alone.' This conclusion is drawn based on assuming others' mental states or intentions without concrete evidence beyond their denial. The speaker is inferring distrust directly from the denial, implying assumptions about the others' honesty or behavior without further proof. This aligns most closely with 'Mind Reading', where the speaker believes they know what others are thinking or how they will act based on limited information.",Mind Reading

The person admits to irritation but also appreciates and loves their family, which suggests a balanced view rather than an extreme or distorted one. There is no indication of absolute terms, fortune-telling, labeling, or emotional reasoning that would show a distortion. The usage of 'often' and 'most of the times' suggests a realistic reflection rather than overgeneralization or mental filter.

This reflects a cognitive distortion where one assumes a future event will turn out badly, typically known as fortune-telling. The subsequent action of contacting the mother's friend to intervene supports that the person believes the negative outcome is likely, rather than uncertain.",Fortune-telling

They describe their obsession with a book as 'really unhealthy' and acknowledge it had a 'negative effect' despite their love for it.

The statement does not show an absolute evaluation (All-or-Nothing), nor does it predict the future (Fortune-telling), assume others' thoughts (Mind Reading), or impose labels on self or others in a simplistic way (Labeling). The speaker is not generalizing from a single event broadly (Overgeneralization) or making 'should' statements.

The use of the word ""always"" suggests a pattern where the speaker believes that every attempt to discuss the issue leads to the same negative outcome. This indicates a tendency to generalize one or a few instances to all interactions. The statement does not explicitly show jumping to conclusions about feelings or thoughts of the other person, nor does it demonstrate labeling oneself or others, nor is there evidence of should statements or exaggerations.

Phrases like ""I am a big annoyance and bother"" and ""You are a dangerous disgusting disgrace"" are examples of assigning negative and global labels to the self based on behavior or experiences. This goes beyond recognizing specific mistakes and directly labels the person in a negative, absolute way. While there are elements of emotional reasoning (interpreting feeling like an annoyance as being one), the key distortion is the labeling of the self with harsh, global negative terms.

429,He has always lied and been spiteful.,"""He has always lied"" and ""been spiteful""","The phrase ""He has always lied"" is a key indicator of overgeneralization, as it applies a single negative behavior across all times without exception. The use of ""always"" extends a specific instance or period to an infinite time frame, which is characteristic of overgeneralization. Labeling involves assigning a negative label to a person, but here the emphasis is on all instances of behavior rather than a single label. Therefore, the dominant distortion is overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

The use of the word ""constantly"" suggests the behavior happens all the time, which is a form of overgeneralizing from specific instances to a broad, unchanging pattern. The statement does not reflect absolute either/or thinking, labeling, or predicting the future without evidence but rather makes a sweeping assumption about the person based on repeated behavior.",Overgeneralization

There is no evidence of exaggerating consequences (Magnification), predicting future (Fortune-telling), or making absolute judgments (All-or-Nothing). The focus is on the emotional experience and the conclusion drawn from that feeling (I didn’t deal with it well), which aligns with Emotional Reasoning—assuming that emotions reflect reality.

This reflects predicting a future outcome without concrete proof, which aligns with 'fortune-telling'. The concern about the phone being checked shows caution but does not involve a cognitive distortion by itself.

The speaker believes no girl could love them and assumes others are involved with someone else, reflecting a generalized negative self-view and expectation of rejection. The quitting of the job due to discomfort around people further illustrates a pervasive negative belief about social interactions.

They are reasoning that since their panic attacks differ from what they believe is typical, their feelings must be caused by something else. This indicates relying on emotions or subjective feelings ('I feel this way, but because it's different, it must be caused by something else'), rather than objective evidence. This fits the pattern of Emotional Reasoning, where one assumes their feelings reflect objective reality.",Emotional Reasoning

The phrase ""I feel like I am bad at showing affection towards him"" reflects a negative self-assessment based on feelings rather than objective evidence, which also ties into emotional reasoning. However, the stronger distortion here is the tendency to generalize an entire experience as being negative ""for everything I did,"" which exemplifies Overgeneralization more clearly than merely Emotional Reasoning.",Overgeneralization

The individual generalizes from specific events (lack of friends, past heartbreak, lack of motivation) to a sweeping conclusion that their future is unhappy and lonely. These thoughts reflect an overextension of singular negative experiences into broad, overarching negative predictions.

Additionally, ""He constantly does things to self-sabotage"" is a generalization but the core issue in the statement is rooted in the feeling that hope is absent, which is derived from emotional perception rather than fact. Therefore, this reflects Emotional Reasoning where the speaker's feelings dictate their conclusion about the situation.",Emotional Reasoning

This involves predicting negative outcomes about David's feelings in the future without concrete evidence, which aligns with the idea of 'fortune-telling.' It is not simply labeling or emotional reasoning because the speaker is projecting future outcomes.

This implies a perceived lack of self-control triggered by external stimuli. There is an assumption that encountering another girl will always lead to these actions, which is a prediction about future behavior based on current patterns.

However, the main focus is on positively evaluating the person's intelligence and potential to the extreme, calling her possibly the most intelligent person known. This suggests an exaggeration or overemphasis of positive traits. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing extremes, personalization, or negative labeling, but rather a magnified positive appraisal. Therefore, the main distortion is Magnification, as the strength of her intelligence and potential is being overstated.",Magnification

Now I can’t think about any other things, except harming thoughts.","I can’t stop these thoughts; I feel that I’m losing my mind; I can’t think about any other things, except harming thoughts.","The statement reflects a sense of uncontrollable, intrusive thoughts and a feeling of losing control over one’s mind. The focus on only 'harming thoughts' indicates a filtering of attention exclusively on negative, distressing content, blocking out any other thoughts or perspectives. This aligns with the 'Mental filter' distortion, where a person filters out all positive or neutral information and focuses only on the negative aspects.",Mental filter

They attribute their awkwardness directly to the breakup without certainty, suggesting an assumption that the breakup has negatively affected their conscience or internal state. This is an example of Emotional Reasoning because the person uses their feelings (awkwardness, change in conscience) as evidence of a cause/effect relationship rather than objective evidence. They are interpreting their emotional state as confirmation of a psychological impact caused by the breakup.",Emotional Reasoning

The decision to quit weed is based on the experience of panic attacks linked to it. The key distortion involves predicting negative outcomes (developing schizophrenia) leading to anxiety.

456,"I’m struggling to do anything at all, all I really want to do is sit somewhere on my own and rot away forever.",I'm struggling to do anything at all; all I really want to do is sit somewhere on my own and rot away forever.,"The statement reflects a negative and absolute viewpoint about the speaker's current and future state. The phrase 'struggling to do anything at all' implies a sense of complete failure or incapacity. The desire to 'rot away forever' suggests a hopeless, all-encompassing conclusion about their situation without considering alternative possibilities or nuances. This reflects an extreme, either-or way of thinking, which characterizes all-or-nothing thinking. The statement does not illustrate predicting future events (fortune-telling), interpreting others' thoughts (mind reading), or assigning negative labels to oneself or others directly. Nor does it show personalization, should statements, or magnification of specific details. Thus, the key distortion is the dichotomous, absolute nature of the thought.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The person expresses a repeated experience of fear whenever attempting to take career steps but does not specify events that justify this fear, indicating an internal emotional state influencing their perception. This is consistent with emotional reasoning, where feelings are taken as evidence of reality ('I feel fear → therefore, there is something wrong or 'nothing to do with my life'). The statement is not about predicting specific future events (which would be fortune-telling), nor is it an all-or-nothing view of success or failure explicitly stated. There are no indications of labeling (putting self down with labels) or personalization (self-blame for external events).

This indicates they are drawing a broad conclusion about the frequency and pattern of behavior based on several instances. The statement reflects a pattern of negative thinking applied broadly to many nights, which aligns with the distortion of overgeneralizing from specific episodes to a general rule.",Overgeneralization

This reflects a pattern of drawing a general conclusion from a limited set of evidence, which is characteristic of overgeneralization. Additionally, the statement ""i am what my mom tells me"" shows the speaker accepting a negative label about themselves without questioning it, directly fitting the definition of labeling, where one assigns a global negative identity to oneself. Although both distortions are present, the dominant cognitive distortion appears to be labeling because the speaker internalizes and accepts an imposed negative identity, which heavily influences their overall negative outlook.",Labeling

This reflects a pattern of seeing events as a repetitive cycle based on a single negative experience (failure). The phrase ""I see everything in cycles"" indicates a tendency to generalize one failure into an ongoing, inevitable loop.

This suggests a tendency to simplify complexity into a broad, fixed label capturing the entire person's nature. The phrase 'simply does what he has to do to get by' provides a mild explanation but does not counterbalance the strong labeling. Therefore, the distortion involves attributing a rigid label to an individual based on limited information, consistent with the definition of Labeling.",Labeling
467,I guess I didn’t really plan for it or think about how it might affect me.,didn’t really plan for it or think about how it might affect me,"The statement reflects a retrospective self-criticism focused on the lack of planning and foresight regarding a situation’s impact. It does not involve viewing things in extremes (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future negatively without evidence (Fortune-telling), or assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading). There is no evidence of dismissing positive information (Mental filter) or blowing things out of proportion (Magnification). Instead, it involves expressing regret about not doing something that 'should' have been done, which aligns with 'Should statements' where the person criticizes themselves for not meeting certain expectations or standards.",Should statements

The phrase 'feel I wasted my 20s' generalizes this negative judgment to a broad time frame. There is also an emotional basis ('I feel') driving these negative conclusions about self-worth and social abilities. This indicates a tendency to overgeneralize specific negative feelings and experiences across a wide context and time period.,Overgeneralization

The key phrase ‘I have allowed terrible behavior’ reflects some self-blame. Most importantly, the speaker speculates on why others cheated, linking it causally to his jealous nature without evidence. This speculation about why others behaved a certain way fits the definition of Fortune-telling—predicting or assuming causes/events without factual certainty. The reasoning is primarily about assuming motives of others (cheating due to jealousy) rather than direct evidence.",Fortune-telling

This suggests they are interpreting their emotional state based solely on feelings rather than objective evidence. The phrase 'I feel like it's fake happiness' exemplifies emotional reasoning—believing something to be true because of how they feel, despite contrary evidence (e.g., actual happiness). The focus on feelings as proof rather than facts strongly indicates Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

The person believes their intended message is being misunderstood or not conveyed properly. This involves assuming that others do not understand their intended meaning, aligning with the concept of 'Mind Reading,' where one believes they know how others interpret their words without explicit confirmation.",Mind Reading
476,"He has terrible temper issues, any simple thing which is not as per his expectation causes him to get seriously mad and as per him he says that he turns into a totally different person, he says things that he doesn’t mean which kind of an emotional abuse to the other person, he does his best to hurt the person in front of him emotionally, and sometimes he hits anything in front of him -not people but things- he even hit his hand in the wall many times.",He has terrible temper issues; any simple thing not as per his expectation causes him to get seriously mad; he says he turns into a totally different person; he says things he doesn’t mean which is emotional abuse; he does his best to hurt the other person emotionally; sometimes he hits objects and even hits his hand against the wall.,"The statement characterizes the person with a global negative label 'terrible temper issues' and describes his reactions as a fixed trait affecting multiple situations. The term 'he says that he turns into a totally different person' implies a rigid, categorical negative identity, rather than considering variability or gradations in behavior. This indicates a tendency to label the person in an absolute, global manner rather than nuanced or context-specific descriptions. While other distortions like magnification or emotional reasoning might be relevant, the central distortion is the global negative labeling of the individual's character and behavior.",Labeling
477,My family is going through basically a break up because of my Aunt.,My family is going through basically a break up because of my Aunt.,"The statement implies a sweeping conclusion about the entire family relationship being broken up solely due to the Aunt's involvement. It generalizes the situation in a dramatic way without evidence of the finality or totality implied by a 'break up'. This suggests a form of overgeneralization, where one event or conflict is taken as representative of the whole family dynamic collapsing.",Overgeneralization

My voice is drowned out, and the thought of how quiet my voice sounds turns me off from saying anything at all because no one can hear me so people talk over me.",I’m not a normal person. I’m a boring person. My voice is drowned out. No one can hear me so people talk over me.,"The speaker assigns broad negative labels to themselves such as 'not a normal person' and 'boring person', which reflects a tendency to define oneself in an overly absolute and negative manner based on isolated feelings or situations. This labeling distorts self-perception by turning specific experiences or traits into a global negative identity. While elements like 'my voice is drowned out' describe a situation, the core distortion lies in the harsh, global self-labeling.",Labeling

But i also am angry all the time towards my mother. she grosses me out but i cant control it.,I’m too young to be worrying about my life the way I do; I am angry all the time towards my mother; she grosses me out but I can't control it.,"The statement 'I’m too young to be worrying about my life the way I do' implies a self-imposed rule about how one should or should not feel based on age, reflecting a 'should' or 'must' condition. The persistent anger and feeling disgusted toward the mother, combined with the perception of an uncontrollable reaction, suggest the speaker is judging their emotions with a standard tied to their age rather than accepting their feelings as valid regardless of age. This aligns best with 'Should statements,' where the distortion involves imposing strict, often unrealistic rules about how one or others should behave or feel.",Should statements
480,"And I feel I will never be the type of man she truly adores, not a talented and poetic, famous musician","I will never be the type of man she truly adores, not a talented and poetic, famous musician","The statement expresses a prediction about the future ('I will never be...'), indicating a belief that the desired outcome (being truly adored) will not happen because the speaker is not a certain type of person (talented, poetic, famous musician). This reflects making a negative forecast without evidence, which is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling'. The thought is not about all-or-nothing extremes or labeling, but a specific prediction about future rejection based on criteria the speaker sees as necessary.",Fortune-telling
481,He doesn’t seem to trust others even me or my brother. He seems suspicious of others all the time.,He doesn’t seem to trust others even me or my brother. He seems suspicious of others all the time.,"The statement assumes the person's trust issues extend broadly to others based on observed suspicion towards specific people including the speaker and their brother. It generalizes the person's suspicious nature to all others 'all the time,' without evidence for every individual or situation. This is indicative of drawing a broad conclusion from limited examples.",Overgeneralization

This reflects internalization of a negative label. Furthermore, the person expects that if they disclose their possible bulimia, the other will dismiss it as imaginary ('it’s all in your head'), which indicates assumption about the other's thoughts without direct evidence (mind reading). However, the central cognitive distortion revolves around the internalized negative label given by the other person ('irresponsible'), which is shaping their negative self-view and communication avoidance. Thus, the dominant distortion is 'Labeling' since the individual is accepting and internalizing an unfair negative label that defines them globally rather than seeing individual behaviors distinctly.",Labeling
483,"Due to this I keep questioning whether or not I feel anything at all or why I just can’t experience true, full emotions.","I keep questioning whether or not I feel anything at all; why I just can’t experience true, full emotions","The statement reflects a persistent doubt about one's own emotional experience, focusing on an inability to feel 'true, full emotions.' This doubt involves interpreting the absence of clear emotional feelings as evidence that the speaker might not be experiencing emotions at all. This aligns with 'Emotional Reasoning,' where feelings or the lack thereof are taken as factual evidence about reality (i.e., 'I don’t feel anything, so I must not have emotions'). There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions, but rather an interpretation based purely on internal emotional states.",Emotional Reasoning
484,"If I don’t find some drastic way to prove I’m sick, I don’t think I’ll get help.","""If I don’t find some drastic way to prove I’m sick, I don’t think I’ll get help.""","The statement implies a prediction about the future based on the inability to prove sickness in a 'drastic' way. The speaker assumes that without drastic proof, help will definitely not come, reflecting an anticipation of a negative outcome without evidence. This is a form of predicting a negative outcome, which matches the characteristic of 'Fortune-telling' cognitive distortion.",Fortune-telling

They infer others' thoughts and feelings based on their own insecurities and lack of popularity. Additionally, the statement about parents never listening and not understanding is a broad generalization about their relationships. While there are elements of emotional reasoning and overgeneralization, the central distortion is assuming knowledge of others’ thoughts (classmates being annoyed), which fits mind reading best.",Mind Reading

They deduce that it must stem from the partner’s issues instead of considering other possibilities or themselves as reasons. This reflects the cognitive distortion known as 'Mind Reading' where one assumes they understand someone else’s thoughts or feelings without direct evidence, and it also slightly overlaps with 'Personalization' if the speaker took blame, but here explicitly denies that. The key point is the assumption about the cause of the partner's feelings without knowing for sure, reflecting 'Mind Reading.'",Mind Reading

This shows a form of anticipating a future event without evidence, which aligns with the cognitive distortion where one assumes they know exactly what will happen, especially a negative event. Although rumination is present, the core distortion is the assumption that an undesired future event will occur.",Fortune-telling
488,"thers, to my friends especially, I appear bright and happy, and they never notice what’s happening to me.","I appear bright and happy to my friends, and they never notice what’s happening to me.",The statement reflects a belief that others (friends) do not notice the speaker's true feelings or situation. This involves assuming to know what others are thinking or perceiving without direct evidence. The key cognitive distortion here is 'Mind Reading' because the person presumes the thoughts and perceptions of others (that friends never notice their true feelings) rather than that being a confirmed fact.,Mind Reading

I barely have any friends and I never talk to the ones I do have because I feel like they all hate me and think I’m annoying.,feel like such a failure and like such a burden on everyone; feel like they all hate me and think I’m annoying,"The statement includes the belief that others hate the speaker and find them annoying, which is inferred without direct evidence. This corresponds to believing you know what others think about you, fitting the definition of Mind Reading. Though there is some negative self-labeling ('failure', 'burden'), the core distortion driving the speaker’s negative emotion is the assumption about others’ thoughts. Hence, the primary distortion is Mind Reading.",Mind Reading

People will probably believe her over me, because, lately I’ve been going through some trust issues with my dad.","The statement shows the person predicting a negative outcome — that if they speak out, the other person will lie and others will believe the liar instead of them. This prediction is based on a current emotional context (trust issues with dad) and includes an assumption about what others will think or do without evidence.

This is a classic example of fortune-telling, where the person assumes a negative outcome will definitely happen without evidence. The speaker is not just worried but assumes the worst-case scenario will unfold.",Fortune-telling

I have a hard time even having any sort of friendship or relationship now because i know they will all eventually leave me also.,everyone want to leave; i have a hard time having any sort of friendship or relationship now because i know they will all eventually leave me,"The statement reflects a belief that all people possess a uniform and negative behavior toward the speaker (everyone wants to leave). This indicates a pattern where one negative event or idea is generalized to all situations or people. The phrase 'they will all eventually leave me also' shows the expectation that every relationship or friendship will end negatively, pointing to overgeneralization rather than predicting the future with certainty (which would indicate fortune-telling). The speaker is not just predicting but concluding a universal truth based on past or present experiences.",Overgeneralization

It acknowledges stressors and trauma but does not exaggerate beyond the facts presented or attribute undue blame to oneself or others. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, fortune-telling, or mind reading. The speaker is describing their reality in a factual manner without distorting it.

The phrase 'even if I were average, it wasn’t good enough at all' shows an all-or-nothing mindset where only perfection or being well above average is acceptable, and anything less is seen as failure.

496,I do not enjoy going shopping with him as it always ends up with us arguing.,I do not enjoy going shopping with him as it always ends up with us arguing.,"The key phrase is 'it always ends up with us arguing.' The speaker implies that every time they go shopping together, an argument occurs without exception. This is an example of taking one or a few instances of arguing and generalizing that it happens every time, which is a characteristic of Overgeneralization. There is no indication of assuming thoughts or feelings of the other person (Mind Reading), nor is there a sense of absolute all-or-nothing framing beyond this repeated conclusion.

This is an extreme evaluation of self-worth that generalizes one attribute (appearance) to the whole self. The phrase indicates a harsh and absolute label about personal identity. This aligns with 'Labeling,' where a person assigns a negative label to themselves rather than seeing their behavior or feelings in context.",Labeling
500,I feel like a useless person.,"""I feel like a useless person.""","The statement generalizes the entire self-worth into a single negative label 'useless person' based on a feeling.

This involves predicting a negative outcome ('med has failed') without sufficient evidence, which is a hallmark of Fortune-telling, where one assumes future or current outcomes negatively without proof. It is not All-or-Nothing because the language is not absolute; not Emotional Reasoning because it is not based on feelings; not Labeling because there's no self-label; not Magnification as there is no exaggeration; not Mental filter because no selective attention is evident; not Mind Reading because no assumptions about others' thoughts are made; not Overgeneralization since it is based on specific events; not Personalization as it's about medication effect; and not Should statements as there is no 'should' or 'must'.",Fortune-telling

517,i feel dizzy everyday and want to vomit nearly everyday.,i feel dizzy everyday and want to vomit nearly everyday,"The statement reflects a broad and repeated experience of feeling dizzy and wanting to vomit almost every day. The use of 'everyday' and 'nearly everyday' indicates that the person is generalizing these symptoms to all or nearly all days without exception.

The statement generalizes the experience of dizziness and headache across all times, which fits the pattern of overgeneralization where one negative event or experience is viewed as a permanent, pervasive issue.",Overgeneralization
522,"No matter how much it hurts to wake up every morning and LIVE, they wont let me die. I would be selfish for leaving them like this. But isn’t it selfish from them to make me live although this thing called life suffocates me?",It hurts to wake up every morning and live; they won't let me die; I would be selfish for leaving them; they are selfish for making me live despite the suffering.,"The statement involves interpreting emotions as facts (life 'suffocates me'), assigning motives to others without evidence ('they won't let me die', 'isn't it selfish from them?'), and evaluating actions as selfishness on both sides. Specifically, the idea that 'they won't let me die' and attributing selfishness to others for making the person live points to an assumption about others' intentions without clear proof, which corresponds to 'Mind Reading'. The person presumes to know what others are thinking and their motivations without actual evidence.",Mind Reading

This involves making a specific prediction about future outcomes based on current anxieties. Such prediction about a negative future outcome aligns with 'Fortune-telling', as it assumes the worst will happen without sufficient basis.",Fortune-telling
524,Earlier this year I broke up with my boyfriend that I was with since I was 14. This break up came as a great shock and I went through a lot of pain. Two months later my godson of only 10 months dies. His death hit me hard because he is the first close family member I’ve lost to death. He was my pillar of strength and the reason that I kept going even though I was broken into pieces so when he left everything changed.,He was my pillar of strength and the reason that I kept going even though I was broken into pieces so when he left everything changed.,"The speaker attributes their entire ability to keep going to the godson being alive, stating that when he died 'everything changed.' This reflects an all-or-nothing perspective where their emotional stability depends solely on this one person. The expression 'everything changed' indicates a global negative conclusion based on one event, which is characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The speaker acknowledges this perception but also shows proactive behavior by stating ""I’m trying to work on it,"" implying awareness and effort to manage the situation. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, labeling, mental filtering, mind reading, overgeneralization, personalization, or should statements in this expression. The main distortion is magnification, as the problem is seen as severely out of control.",Magnification
526,I feel selfish and stupid.,"""selfish"" and ""stupid""","The statement assigns negative global labels to oneself based on feelings or possibly isolated actions, reflecting a tendency to define oneself in a damaging way.

527,I have also had a few suicide attempts in the past… And lately I keep thinking about them and remembering them.,I have also had a few suicide attempts in the past… And lately I keep thinking about them and remembering them.,"The statement focuses on repeatedly thinking about past suicide attempts. This reflects selective attention to negative memories or experiences while potentially ignoring other aspects of the self or present life. This is characteristic of the 'Mental filter' distortion, where a person's attention is filtered through negative details, leading to a biased perception. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or other distortions such as labeling or fortune-telling in this sentence. The key is the sustained focus on negative memories without broader context.",Mental filter
528,I fear that I’m in the stages of prodromal psychosis,I fear that I’m in the stages of prodromal psychosis,"The statement expresses a fear about a future or current mental health condition without concrete evidence presented.

This anticipates a negative outcome based on assumptions about how future influence might affect current preferences. This is a classic example of predicting a negative future event without certainty.,Fortune-telling
531,I basically feel like I’ve been working out 24/7 even when I’m not.,I basically feel like I’ve been working out 24/7 even when I’m not.,"The statement reflects a belief based on an emotional feeling rather than objective evidence.

It moves beyond isolated incidents to a broader claim about the entire period and interaction with the manager. This suggests the speaker is generalizing a specific set of experiences to characterize an ongoing situation.

The focus is on the intense emotion ('I get so angry that my body vibrates') as direct evidence of the situation’s negativity. The person seems to use their strong emotional reaction as proof that the other person's actions are inappropriate or harmful. This indicates Emotional Reasoning—where feelings are interpreted as objective truth without considering alternative explanations or perspectives.,Emotional Reasoning

The speaker claims that anger is the only emotion truly felt, while all other emotions seem diminished or insubstantial ('a shadow of what I should feel'). This suggests the speaker is judging their feelings based on an internal emotional standard or expectation ('what I should feel'). This involves interpreting their current emotions through the lens of how they believe emotions ought to be, which aligns with 'Should statements' cognitive distortion. It is not a case of all-or-nothing thinking, as the speaker is not categorizing things in extremes but rather comparing current feelings to a standard. It’s not emotional reasoning, as the speaker is more reflecting about lack rather than assuming something is true because of feeling. Therefore, the key distortion is 'Should statements.'",Should statements

I felt disgusted by myself, wanted to die, thought that I don’t deserve to live or even go to heaven.","I felt disgusted by myself, wanted to die, thought that I don’t deserve to live or even go to heaven.","The statement reflects deep negative self-judgment and feelings of worthlessness based on a momentary experience. The thought 'I don’t deserve to live or even go to heaven' indicates an extreme conclusion about one's value and right to exist.

The use of ""never"" conveys an absolute, all-encompassing view of the problem without exception.

The speaker questions whether their personality or behavior is the reason for failed friendships, reflecting self-blame. This indicates a conclusion about all friendships based on limited experiences. The idea that only school friends can be made due to lack of other opportunities also limits potential exceptions, suggesting a broad generalization beyond the current facts. Thus, it fits overgeneralization, where one concludes that all social attempts fail, which is an unwarranted broad conclusion.",Overgeneralization

This suggests a magnification of the current distress and an overgeneralization that the feeling is permanent. Additionally, the anxiety from meta-cognition ('thinking about thinking') supports a distorted emotional interpretation. The strongest cognitive distortion here is the assumption that the current emotional pain is inescapable and permanent, which reflects Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

The statement reflects frustration and a negative emotional response to these repeated actions, but it is not interpreting the situation based on assumed thoughts (no mind reading), nor does it involve extreme black-or-white thinking (all-or-nothing), nor is it based on feelings as evidence (emotional reasoning). It is also not about making predictions about the future (fortune-telling), assigning a global negative label (labeling), or focusing on a single detail to the exclusion of others (mental filter). The statement doesn’t include 'should' or 'must' statements either. The key distortion is interpreting the mother’s behavior as always the same negative pattern, consistent with overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

The feeling of being grossed out is taken as evidence that the situation is bad or unacceptable without further rational evaluation. This matches the definition of Emotional Reasoning, where one's emotions are used as proof of reality rather than objective facts. There is no evidence of other distortions like Fortune-telling, All-or-Nothing Thinking, or Mind Reading in this immediate emotional reaction.",Emotional Reasoning

This reflects a pattern where the individual is diminishing their own narratives, which aligns with magnification only if they were exaggerating. However, since the person is actually minimizing rather than exaggerating, the distortion is not magnification but rather a misinterpretation of their own behavior. The key distortion is labeling: the person is negatively labeling themselves as a liar despite the complexities of their experiences. The statement ‘I lie about things I don’t need to lie about’ applies a negative, global label to themselves based on perceived dishonesty. Hence, labeling best fits the cognitive distortion present.",Labeling

Constantly being reminded just makes me feel dumb and worthless and unlovable.,"The statement expresses a strong negative emotional evaluation based on feelings rather than objective evidence. The person feels 'dumb and worthless and unlovable' simply because they are being constantly reminded, indicating that they believe their emotions reflect the reality of their worth. This corresponds to Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are interpreted as facts about oneself or the situation. Other distortions such as Labeling are present (calling self 'dumb' and 'worthless'), but the core distortion driving the belief is Emotional Reasoning, as the negative self-labels stem directly from the feeling caused by external reminders.",Emotional Reasoning

The phrase 'making a huge deal' indicates the person is possibly exaggerating the importance or impact of the issue. This points towards Magnification, where the negative aspects are blown out of proportion. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or fortune-telling. Emotional reasoning could be considered but the emphasis is on the scale of the problem rather than emotional state as proof. Therefore, the distortion best fitting is Magnification.",Magnification

The key phrase 'My home life is horrible' is an extreme evaluation that reflects an absolute negative judgment, likely without consideration of any positive aspect. Additionally, the statement includes a label applied to oneself ('call me the abusive one'), and personal symptoms like panic attacks and vomiting after trauma. However, the overarching theme is a broad and absolute negative evaluation of home life using the word 'horrible,' which indicates an all-or-nothing (black-and-white) thinking pattern rather than a complex mixture of distortions.

The statement 'plagued by ... problems all throughout my childhood' suggests a broad negative generalization about the past without nuanced evidence, which aligns with Overgeneralization. However, since the key claim rests heavily on being absolutely sure ('dead certain') about a fixed state ('born this way'), this primarily reflects Emotional Reasoning because the belief is anchored in an internal emotional certainty rather than concrete proof or balanced thought.",Emotional Reasoning

The key cognitive distortion appears in the prediction about future behavior: 'if this happens again i probably pretty much will react the same.' This is a prediction about a future event without certainty, suggesting an assumption that the outcome will replicate exactly what happened in the past. This fits the definition of Fortune-telling, where one predicts negative outcomes as certain without evidence.

The key phrase 'frequently make me feel like I do not belong' indicates interpreting others' actions as intentional rejection. This reflects the cognitive distortion of 'Mind Reading,' where the person assumes they know what others think or feel about them (in this case, that they do not belong). There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, magnification of the situation beyond what is supported, overgeneralization beyond the children, or emotional reasoning as the primary distortion. The focus is on interpreting others' thoughts and intentions negatively without explicit evidence.",Mind Reading

As a boyfriend, I find myself constantly annoyed and angry with him because I feel like he doesn’t understand me, and he says he feels the same.","The speaker initially describes the person as 'perfect' in one role (friend) but experiences negative emotions and conflicts when the person is in another role (boyfriend). This shift reflects a change in perception rather than a cognitive distortion about the other person. The statement does not generalize all experiences beyond the specific context, so it's not Overgeneralization. The speaker bases their feelings on the reality of their emotional experience rather than assuming facts not in evidence, so it’s not Fortune-telling or Mind Reading. The expression 'he was perfect as a friend' and 'constantly annoyed and angry as a boyfriend' contrasts two different experiences rather than applying an extreme, black-and-white evaluation of the person overall. The speaker also acknowledges the mutual feeling of misunderstanding, which grounds the perception in shared experience rather than distorted thinking. Therefore, none of the standard cognitive distortions listed apply clearly here; the statement reflects a natural complexity in relationships rather than a distorted thinking pattern.",No Distortion
571,"I feel like I am often mentally healthy, then have these bad depressive episodes, or just these mental breakdowns and get self-destructive and feel like I fall down a rabbit hole.","I feel like I am often mentally healthy, then have these bad depressive episodes, or just these mental breakdowns and get self-destructive and feel like I fall down a rabbit hole.","The statement describes fluctuations between feeling mentally healthy and experiencing negative depressive episodes and breakdowns. The person acknowledges these shifts without generalizing that they are always unhealthy or always healthy, which rules out All-or-Nothing Thinking and Overgeneralization. There is no evidence of assuming what others think (Mind Reading), making should statements, or Fortune-telling. Instead, the person is interpreting their feelings as evidence of reality (emotional reasoning)—linking their emotional state directly to how they view their mental health. Although they mention falling down a rabbit hole (a metaphor for descent into worse states), the focus is on feeling self-destructive and having depressive breakdowns based on feelings rather than external evidence. This fits Emotional Reasoning best.",Emotional Reasoning

This indicates a black-and-white perspective where the beliefs are seen only as harmful and must be entirely removed without consideration of any nuance or potential positive aspects.

He was caring, loving, showed his emotions; made sure I had what I needed.""","The statement outlines multiple negative behaviors of the individual, emphasizing 'he always blamed me for everything,' which indicates a pattern of attributing all fault to the speaker. This is a clear example of overgeneralization, where one negative aspect is applied broadly to the entire scenario or person. However, the speaker balances this with the recognition that he wasn’t always this way and had positive traits, which rules out all-or-nothing thinking. There is no indication of assuming thoughts (mind reading), predicting the future (fortune-telling), or distorting emotions as facts (emotional reasoning). The key distortion is attributing everything negative to him and assuming this pattern applies broadly without exceptions, which fits overgeneralization best.",Overgeneralization

This shows a conclusion about the self being 'distinctly socially different' based on internal feelings and perceptions. Rather than relying on objective evidence, the individual is inferring a negative global trait about themselves from their emotional experience. This reasoning aligns with 'Labeling' because it involves assigning a broad, negative identity or characteristic ('socially different') to oneself based on perceived emotional differences.",Labeling

The person is concluding they are stressed and sad because they are experiencing physical symptoms and intense emotions.

579,"So we just are desperate, because we feel that hugging her is not enough to help her be happy again.","we just are desperate, because we feel that hugging her is not enough to help her be happy again","The statement assumes that hugging her should be sufficient to make her happy again. The feeling of desperation arises from the belief that this single action is inadequate, implying an unrealistic expectation or 'should' about what hugging can achieve. This aligns with 'Should statements' cognitive distortion, where one holds rigid rules or expectations about how things ought to be, leading to frustration when they are not met.",Should statements

It implies that without an answer, the person will continue to feel guilty or believe something is inherently wrong with them. This reflects a tendency to internalize distress and personalize ambiguous feelings as a flaw or defect within themselves. The focus is on self-blame and assuming personal fault, which matches the definition of Personalization. There is no clear evidence of other distortions such as All-or-Nothing Thinking (no absolute terms), Fortune-telling (no predictions about the future), or Emotional Reasoning (no conclusions drawn solely from feelings without evidence).",Personalization

This indicates a black-and-white perspective without acknowledging any middle ground or exceptions. The use of 'never' implies an all-encompassing negative view that ignores any potential positive behavior. Such rigid categorization fits the pattern of 'All-or-Nothing Thinking.'",All-or-Nothing Thinking

586,I was so disapointed on this celebrity childhood idol of mine for changing her image.,I was so disappointed on this celebrity childhood idol of mine for changing her image.,"The statement expresses disappointment because the celebrity changed her image. This reflects a rigid expectation of how the celebrity 'should' be based on past perception, and disappointment arises from the deviation from that expectation. The key cognitive distortion here involves imposing a rule or expectation ('the celebrity should remain the same as my childhood idol') and evaluating the situation negatively because the 'should' was violated.

The addition of 'especially in the last few months since he is going to his psychotherapist' attempts to link the behavior to a new cause, but does not necessarily reflect a distortion by itself.

This suggests a black-and-white perspective, without acknowledging any complexity or possible negative aspects prior to the split. The speaker uses absolute terms like 'never' and 'always' which supports an all-or-nothing way of thinking.

This indicates an exaggeration of the danger or impact these items hold, rather than a balanced view of the situation. The phrase does not suggest absolute terms (All-or-Nothing), predicting future outcomes (Fortune-telling), interpreting thoughts or feelings of others (Mind Reading), or personal blame (Personalization). It also does not use 'should' statements or focus selectively on negative details (Mental filter). Therefore, the distortion best fits the pattern of Magnification.",Magnification

The individual does not label themselves or others negatively, nor do they appear to be generalizing from a single event or filtering information. The uncertainty and observation of emotional volatility point towards an acceptance or acknowledgement of feelings without distortion.

It acknowledges the ongoing symptoms without exaggeration or negative cognitive bias beyond the factual impact. The wording is grounded in personal experience and realistic effects rather than distorted thinking patterns such as overgeneralization or labeling. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of cognitive distortion in the description of the event and its consequences.",No Distortion

My mom is playing the victim role too and she’s too sensitive, pessimistic and lonely.""","The statement uses broad negative character labels such as 'narcissistic', 'closed minded', 'very angry', 'too sensitive', 'pessimistic', and 'lonely' to describe the parents. These labels attribute entire personality traits or identities based on behaviors or perceptions. This fits the definition of Labeling, which involves assigning fixed, global negative labels to oneself or others based on specific actions or traits. The statement does not involve predicting the future (Fortune-telling), thinking in extremes (All-or-Nothing), emphasizing emotions as facts (Emotional Reasoning), or other distortions from the list. Therefore, the best fitting distortion is Labeling.",Labeling

Then, it generalizes a broad social disconnection ('I’m too different I feel like I have nothing in common with them') without concrete evidence, implying a global negative conclusion. The key distortion is primarily the first part relying on feelings as evidence that being needy is bad ('I hate appearing needy'), aligning with emotional reasoning. The second part could indicate overgeneralization, but the core distortion driving the statement is relying on feelings as proof.",Emotional Reasoning

Additionally, ""I feel it a consequence of shyness that doesn’t seem to be wearing off any time soon"" suggests a prediction about the future persistence of shyness. This pattern of assuming knowledge about how things will unfold or what others experience reflects 'Fortune-telling,' where one anticipates negative outcomes or difficulties without certainty.",Fortune-telling

The speaker emphasizes consistent poor treatment and abuse. This indicates forming a broad conclusion about the son’s character and behavior based on repeated negative experiences. This is not about imagining future events, emotional states, or absolutes, but rather summarizing a pattern. It does not seem to be 'Labeling' since it does not put a simplistic label on the son, but a description of actions. The generalization about constant poor treatment suggests drawing a broad conclusion from specific instances. Therefore, the cognitive distortion best fitting this is Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

The speaker feels 'something off' but cannot identify the reason. This reflects an assumption based on feelings rather than concrete evidence, which is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning: interpreting emotional states as proof of reality or facts. The concern is not a prediction (Fortune-telling), nor an extreme label or generalization. It is based on an emotional sense of unease rather than facts.",Emotional Reasoning

The key phrase 'starting to drive me crazy' reflects an assumption that feeling overwhelmed or distressed means the situation is truly unbearable. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as facts about reality. There is no absolute thinking ('all-or-nothing') or predictive claim ('fortune-telling'), nor is there blaming or labeling.

The phrase 'anything else a normal person would react to' implies a comparison between the speaker's emotional experience and that of others, suggesting an assumption about how others feel or should feel. This generalization extends to many different types of events and reactions, indicating a broad application beyond specific incidents. The key cognitive distortion here is overgeneralization, as the speaker applies a single emotional experience (feeling nothing) to all relevant situations and contrasts it with a presumed norm.",Overgeneralization

The individual describes feeling low energy and engaging in behavior (sitting and sulking) that matches their emotional state. There is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or mind reading. Instead, the person seems to be making a direct connection between their emotional state and behavior, which aligns with emotional reasoning—assuming something is true because they feel it strongly (e.g., feeling no energy means just sitting and sulking). The statement also outlines serious mental health conditions, but these are stated factually rather than distortedly. Therefore, the primary distortion is emotional reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

This reflects 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' where situations are viewed in absolute terms without middle ground.

The phrase 'self-diagnosed Pure OCD' indicates subjective interpretation rather than a clinical diagnosis, and the concern about several obsessions and their effects (depression, suicidality) shows a tendency toward catastrophizing or magnifying the impact of these fears and experiences. The mention of continuing to live with abusive parents and being bullied also suggests focusing on negative experiences and their overwhelming impact. However, there is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, inappropriate labeling, or assuming others' thoughts (mind reading). The statement primarily amplifies the severity and impact of fears and negative experiences, which aligns most closely with the distortion type Magnification.",Magnification

This suggests a conclusion that nothing is working, which reflects a generalization about the effectiveness of all treatments tried so far. The statement does not indicate an absolute 'all-or-nothing' perspective, nor does it reflect predicting the future beyond current experience, nor labeling themselves or others, nor magnification of one aspect over others.

The person speculates about possible reasons behind their behavior without clear evidence, essentially predicting or assuming the cause. This indicates a type of distortion where one makes assumptions about future events or outcomes without sufficient proof, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling.' It is not mind reading since it focuses on their own feelings and motives, rather than others'. It is also not emotional reasoning as the doubts are about the reasons, not feelings themselves.

This reflects 'mind reading' where the person assumes what others think or feel (family won’t understand, friends’ advice is no longer comforting). The use of 'never listen' and 'won’t understand' suggests the individual is concluding what others think or will do without verification.",Mind Reading

The use of definitive phrases like 'I can’t' and 'I’m not passionate about anything except painting, but it doesn’t feel like passion' reflects all-or-nothing thinking, as the speaker views their emotional capacity and passion in absolute terms, without acknowledging any middle ground or exceptions.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
636,She is very spoiled and has a horrible attitude.,She is very spoiled and has a horrible attitude.,"The statement assigns global negative characteristics ('spoiled' and 'horrible attitude') to 'she', which is a form of labeling. Labeling is a cognitive distortion where one assigns a fixed, global label to oneself or others based on specific behaviors or incidents, ignoring nuances or exceptions. This differs from distortions like mind reading or emotional reasoning, as it directly applies a negative identity rather than assuming thoughts or feelings. There is no indication of extremes (all-or-nothing), predictions about the future (fortune-telling), or exaggerated focus on a single detail (mental filter). Thus, the most fitting distortion is Labeling.",Labeling

They express difficulty in telling their parents due to a persistent thought that the parents will make fun of them and not believe them. This involves assuming what others are thinking without evidence, which fits the cognitive distortion of mind reading.

There is no evidence of polarized thinking (all-or-nothing), emotional reasoning, predicting the future, or labeling others. The speaker reflects on their behavior and the limitations of their knowledge without overgeneralizing or personalizing. It also does not involve demanding statements about what should or shouldn’t be done. The statement is a realistic acknowledgment of boundaries in applying knowledge learned from books. Therefore, it does not present any cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

This aligns with assuming knowledge about what others are thinking or doing without evidence. The distortion is about assuming others’ thoughts or intentions, which matches the definition of 'Mind Reading'. No other distortion type fits as closely because this is not about all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, labeling, magnification, mental filtering, overgeneralization, personalization, or should statements.

'He texts other women in my house' is a specific behavior, while 'he barely talks to me' is another. The phrase 'he makes me feel unappreciated in every way' generalizes the partner's treatment as universally negative. This suggests the speaker is making a broad generalization about the partner's behavior based on these incidents, expanding specific occurrences to a global negative assessment rather than seeing them as isolated events.

This goes beyond a single behavior or event and instead categorizes the entire self in harsh, simplistic terms.

This fits the pattern of 'Fortune-telling,' which involves predicting a negative future or assuming knowledge about uncertain outcomes. It is not 'Mind Reading' because it doesn't claim to know what the other person is thinking, but rather doubts based on uncertainty.

This reflects a realization of the consequences of avoiding emotional distress rather than a cognitive distortion about the current situation itself. There is no evidence of black-and-white thinking, labeling oneself or others, predicting the future, or emotional reasoning. The individual is recounting a sequence of events without exaggeration or distortion.

It does not involve extreme categories (All-or-Nothing), predictions about the future (Fortune-telling), or assumptions about others' thoughts (Mind Reading). It is not a self-blaming statement (Personalization), nor does it specify what should or should not happen (Should statements). It also does not exemplify focusing on one negative detail to the exclusion of others (Mental filter), or labeling oneself or others globally. The statement is not obviously an example of Emotional Reasoning, which relies on feelings as evidence of truth. Instead, the statement qualifies something as 'strange,' which is a mild evaluation rather than a distortion. There is no amplification of negatives apparent, so Magnification may not fit.

I literally think about him 24/7 and feel an unbearable pain every time I think about him and it’s just too much.,my whole life has been taken away; I can’t stop thinking about him 24/7; feel an unbearable pain every time I think about him; it’s just too much,"The speaker expresses an intense and overwhelming emotional experience, interpreting their feelings as evidence that their entire life is lost. This is a classic example of emotional reasoning, where feelings are taken as incontrovertible facts. The distress (feeling unbearable pain) and the persistent thoughts reinforce this perception. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking or overgeneralization since the focus is on the emotional response to the situation rather than broad conclusions or absolutes. No fortune-telling or mind reading is present, and the statement does not contain 'should' directives or labeling. The main distortion is interpreting feelings as reality.",Emotional Reasoning
665,"I get upset and/or hurt way too easily by other people, and often over trivial things.","I get upset and/or hurt way too easily by other people, and often over trivial things.",The statement suggests the speaker frequently experiences emotional upset from others and perceives the triggering events as 'trivial.' This involves interpreting minor incidents as more significant or hurtful than they objectively might be. This aligns with the distortion where a person exaggerates the importance or impact of certain events.,Magnification
666,I honestly think I’m useless and have no future ahead of me.,"""I’m useless"" and ""have no future ahead of me""",The statement takes an entire aspect of the person's identity ('useless') and applies it broadly and negatively to their whole future ('no future ahead of me'). This reflects an overgeneralization because a single negative feeling or experience is being extended to a total and broad negative conclusion about oneself and one's future.,Overgeneralization
667,But as the years go by I’ve noticed that the same people I’ve helped out seem to either leave me in the dust or I get the feeling they weren’t actually appreciative of me helping them out.,the same people I’ve helped out seem to either leave me in the dust or I get the feeling they weren’t actually appreciative of me helping them out,"The statement generalizes a recurring negative experience with multiple people over a span of years. It suggests a pattern that everyone helped either abandons or is not appreciative, without acknowledging exceptions. This broad conclusion based on limited evidence reflects a sweeping generalization from specific instances to an overall negative pattern.",Overgeneralization
668,"I do like her and want to be with her because seems like it’s only natural that I would develop feelings for her, right? But even though she may not view me in that manner, isn’t it normal for friends to at least hug?",seems like it’s only natural that I would develop feelings for her; even though she may not view me in that manner; isn’t it normal for friends to at least hug,"The statement assumes that developing feelings is 'only natural,' implying an automatic cause-effect relationship without considering individual differences or circumstances, which does not indicate distortion but a reasonable assumption. The speaker also wonders if it is 'normal' for friends to hug even though the other person may not reciprocate the same feelings. This shows uncertainty about the other person's perspective rather than assuming their thoughts or feelings (which would be mind reading). The questioning about norms or what 'should' be done indicates a mild use of 'Should statements,' as the speaker implies an expectation of how friends normally behave. However, the overall tone reflects seeking understanding rather than an absolute or distorted belief. There is no clear irrational or distorted thought present.",No Distortion
669,"So, a lifelong issue (as I’ve come to the realisation of) is that my mood, thoughts and feelings change way too quickly, way too easily and for no strong reason.","my mood, thoughts and feelings change way too quickly, way too easily and for no strong reason","The speaker believes their mood, thoughts, and feelings fluctuate excessively and without justification. This characterization implies a broad and generalized view about their emotional stability, using terms like 'way too quickly' and 'way too easily' which suggest an extreme evaluation of their experience. This reflects an overgeneralization where one aspect of their behavior is interpreted as a pervasive, lifelong issue without considering variability or context.",Overgeneralization
670,Ever since I was little I’ve never fit in.  I always stayed inside and read books at the library.,"""Ever since I was little I’ve never fit in.""","The phrase ""I’ve never fit in"" suggests a conclusion drawn from past repeated experiences, implying the speaker believes this to be an absolute truth based on their entire history. This indicates a pattern where one negative experience is generalized across all time, a hallmark of Overgeneralization. The rest of the sentence describes behavior but does not add distortion by itself.",Overgeneralization
671,i just finished chemo and im getting better but im scared of whats next if my childhood was crap and the time im 18 is cancer how about 21?,"I'm scared of what's next; if my childhood was crap and the time I'm 18 is cancer, how about 21?","The statement expresses a fear about the future based on the current and past negative experiences, specifically anticipating that cancer or other negative outcomes will continue or happen again at age 21. This reflects predicting future events negatively without evidence, which aligns with the distortion of fortune-telling. The person is assuming a negative outcome in the future (age 21) based on current and past hardships.",Fortune-telling
672,I have a friend who we call each other “best friends”;. however she is not really open to me.,"""we call each other 'best friends'"" and ""she is not really open to me""","The statement highlights a discrepancy between the label given to the relationship ('best friends') and the behavior of the friend (not being open). The speaker seems to judge the friend based on this single aspect, implying that because she is not open, she does not live up to the 'best friend' label. This suggests the use of a label as a shortcut to evaluate the entire relationship, which aligns with the 'Labeling' distortion. The speaker assigns a global characteristic or judgment (implied by 'not really open') that might not consider other aspects of the friendship.",Labeling
673,I feel awful that my first reaction was to be selfish and I feel that shows who I really am.,I feel awful that my first reaction was to be selfish; I feel that shows who I really am.,"The speaker interprets their feeling of having a selfish reaction as a definitive indicator of their true character. This is reasoning based on an emotional response ('I feel awful') and using that feeling as evidence of an absolute truth about themselves ('that shows who I really am'). This fits 'Emotional Reasoning' because the emotion (feeling awful) is being used as proof of objective reality (being a selfish person), rather than examining the situation more objectively or considering other factors.",Emotional Reasoning
674,Even though I text her the whole time I’m gone she just seems to shut down emotionally and all I can get is one word responses.,I text her the whole time I’m gone; she just seems to shut down emotionally; all I can get is one word responses,"The statement involves the speaker interpreting the other person's brief responses and perceived emotional shutdown as a definite emotional disconnection. The speaker assumes an emotional state of the other person based on limited external cues (one word responses). This represents inferring the internal emotional state of another without clear evidence, which is characteristic of Mind Reading. There is no absolute or extreme term indicating All-or-Nothing Thinking, no predictions about the future (Fortune-telling), nor blaming oneself (Personalization). The speaker is making assumptions about another’s feelings based on behavior, fitting Mind Reading best.",Mind Reading
675,I do the same to things that I LOVE doing. Eg: 1) I procrastinate doing Homework until the last hour but I love it when I’m doing it. 2) I procrastinate studying for a class but when I finally do I REALLY enjoy it.,I procrastinate doing Homework until the last hour but I love it when I’m doing it; I procrastinate studying for a class but when I finally do I REALLY enjoy it.,"The statement describes a pattern of behavior where the person delays tasks but then finds enjoyment once engaging in them. There is no indication of exaggerating negatives (Magnification), imagining future outcomes negatively (Fortune-telling), or making absolute judgments (All-or-Nothing). The focus is on a habitual behavior linked to enjoyment rather than distorted thinking about self or situation. This reflects an objective observation without cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
676,So we have spent quite a lot of time together and he can’t seem to be away from me for very long.,he can’t seem to be away from me for very long,"The statement interprets the person's behavior as an indication that he must want to be close all the time. This assumes knowledge of the other person's thoughts or feelings without direct evidence, reflecting an assumption about their mental state.",Mind Reading
677,My father is a 75 year old who has been perpetually unemployed for 25 years and spends all day home alone–I imagine this affects his self worth.,"""My father is a 75 year old who has been perpetually unemployed for 25 years and spends all day home alone–I imagine this affects his self worth.""","The statement includes a factual description of the father's situation (age, unemployment, being home alone) and then the speaker makes an assumption about how this situation affects the father's self-worth. The phrase ""I imagine this affects his self worth"" indicates the speaker is making an assumption about the father's internal feelings based on the external facts, without direct evidence. This aligns with the cognitive distortion called Mind Reading, where one presumes to know what another person is thinking or feeling.",Mind Reading
678,"I’m really struggling with understanding how I was a huge part of his life for almost two decades and even though we are still married, his actions show that he truly does not care about me.","‘I was a huge part of his life for almost two decades’, ‘we are still married’, ‘his actions show that he truly does not care about me.’","The speaker is interpreting the spouse’s actions as definitive proof that he does not care about them, despite being married and having a long shared history. This involves drawing an emotional conclusion (he does not care) based on how the speaker feels about the situation ('struggling', interpreting actions negatively), rather than objective facts alone. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as evidence of truth.",Emotional Reasoning
679,"So things seem to be looking up in his life, yet his mental state gets worse and worse. I told him that maybe they were misdiagnosed, and that seemed to ease his mind a bit.","I told him that maybe they were misdiagnosed, and that seemed to ease his mind a bit.","The phrase 'maybe they were misdiagnosed' indicates a prediction or assumption about a future or unknown event without sufficient evidence. This reflects an attempt to predict an outcome (the accuracy of the diagnosis) that cannot be confirmed at the moment. It shows a form of anticipation or forecasting about a situation that may or may not happen, which aligns with the cognitive distortion of 'Fortune-telling'.",Fortune-telling
680,"I cannot figure out what is wrong with me, but there must be.","""I cannot figure out what is wrong with me, but there must be.""","The statement implies a conclusion is drawn despite lacking evidence or clear knowledge. The speaker does not know what is wrong but insists that there must be something wrong. This reflects a form of negative assumption or prediction without concrete proof, fitting the definition of Fortune-telling, where one predicts something negative will happen or be true despite uncertainty.",Fortune-telling
681,Depersonalistion and derealisation were heavy in my life and i always felt out of place and heard voices which i saw as my friends and saw shadows.,Depersonalisation and derealisation were heavy in my life; I always felt out of place; heard voices which I saw as my friends; saw shadows.,"The statement reflects a subjective experience where the individual is interpreting their internal symptoms (feeling out of place, hearing voices, seeing shadows) as a reflection of their reality. The phrase 'always felt out of place' indicates a sweeping, emotionally-charged belief about their social standing or environment. This sense of certainty about how things are felt internally relates to Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as evidence of truth. The presence of symptoms such as depersonalization and derealization is described with emotional weight rather than objective analysis. There is no indication of black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), labeling self or others, exaggerating/catastrophizing (Magnification), filtering evidence selectively (Mental filter), assuming others’ thoughts (Mind Reading), attributing external events to oneself unfairly (Personalization), or rigid rules (Should statements).",Emotional Reasoning
682,My birth mother had a number of different mental health problems that seemed to have possibly ran in the family- because now my little sister and I are experiencing them.,"""My birth mother had a number of different mental health problems"", ""seemed to have possibly ran in the family"", ""now my little sister and I are experiencing them""","The statement links the mother's mental health problems to the siblings' current experiences, implying a hereditary or inevitable pattern. This is a form of overgeneralization, where a specific instance or correlation is expanded to a broader, generalized conclusion that the problem is recurring or bound to happen within the family. The use of 'seemed to have possibly' indicates some uncertainty but still concludes a familial pattern. There is no absolute thinking (all-or-nothing), no emotional reasoning, fortune-telling of future outcomes, labeling of people, or other distortions more fitting. The most fitting cognitive distortion is overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
683,"Then I started to believe I can controle electronics across the globe and someone told me that I really turned off their lights in room, then I tried to test it on other people they said that I can’t turn their lights off, however that one person I still I’m confused if they were lying or not and I’m very convinced they are not and that I have superpowers and it causes me a distress knowing that I indeed caused terrible things using these powers.

The confusion about whether someone is lying and strong conviction that the powers are real suggests a distorted interpretation of reality. The distress caused by believing in these powers and the perception that others are hostile and aware of this indicates personal involvement and responsibility for external events beyond one’s control. This fits the characteristic of 'Personalization' where one believes they are the cause of external events or others’ feelings. Additionally, the assumption that people are hostile and aware of the speaker’s identity without evidence points to 'Mind Reading'. However, since the key distortion revolves around the belief that one’s supposed powers cause terrible things and make others hostile, which is a direct attribution of external events to oneself, 'Personalization' is the primary distortion here.",Personalization
684,Most of the times I can’t hold a normal conversation (I talk to others but not as much as I’d like to) and feel that I’m lacking concentration or don’t give enough attention to others and what they are telling me.,Most of the times I can’t hold a normal conversation; I talk to others but not as much as I’d like to; feel that I’m lacking concentration or don’t give enough attention to others and what they are telling me.,"The statement generalizes the speaker's difficulty in holding conversations to 'most of the times', implying a broad and pervasive problem rather than isolated incidents. This indicates a pattern of overgeneralizing one’s social interactions negatively. The person is not just mentioning a specific instance but applying it to most situations, which is characteristic of overgeneralization. There is no indication that they are labeling themselves or others, predicting the future, or filtering only negative information, but rather making a broad general conclusion based on subjective experiences.",Overgeneralization
685,Her mother hates that and resents her for going there first.,"""Her mother hates that""; ""resents her for going there first""","The statement assumes the mother's emotional state and exact feelings without direct evidence, specifically that she hates and resents her for an action. This reflects the cognitive distortion known as 'Mind Reading,' where one believes they know what another person is thinking or feeling without clear proof. The statement does not reflect exaggeration (Magnification), nor does it present an absolute (All-or-Nothing), nor is it about predicting the future (Fortune-telling). It is not a generalized statement (Overgeneralization) or a personal blame (Personalization), nor expressing a rule (Should). Thus, the best fit is Mind Reading.",Mind Reading
686,"What drove me to continue isolating myself like this was the fact that I was doing well academically. However, I started realizing that all this time in isolation forced me to constantly focus on negative thoughts and I saw a significant decrease in my cognitive ability; things I could previously do quickly in high school took a lot longer now.",I was doing well academically; all this time in isolation forced me to constantly focus on negative thoughts; significant decrease in cognitive ability; things I could previously do quickly now took a lot longer,"The statement highlights how the speaker links their isolation to a negative outcome (decreased cognitive ability). They attribute their slowed cognitive performance specifically to the isolation-induced negative thoughts. This shows a focus on the negative aspect (negative thoughts during isolation) overshadowing any positive or neutral experiences (doing well academically). The speaker emphasizes negatives from a single experience (isolation) and extends it to a broader conclusion about their cognitive ability compared to before. This is consistent with the Mental filter distortion, where negative details are focused on and positives are ignored.",Mental filter
687,"It’s no longer I could never kill; now it’s & I could, and I kind of want to; I want to be like him, even though another part of me screams not to.

I","I could, and I kind of want to; I want to be like him, even though another part of me screams not to. I fear the longer these intense homicidal ideations fuel my mind, I may crumble become my nearly lifelong fear.","The statement reflects a fear that continuing to have these thoughts will eventually lead the person to become what they fear the most (committing a homicide). This indicates a belief in a catastrophic future outcome without clear evidence, which aligns with predicting a negative event will happen. The person is essentially 'fortune-telling' by predicting they will inevitably 'crumble' under these thoughts and become what they fear, despite no definitive proof it will happen.",Fortune-telling
688,I feel so bad because I’m an awful friend for wanting to drop her but I just don’t want to talk about mental illness.,"""I feel so bad"", ""I’m an awful friend"", ""for wanting to drop her"", ""I just don’t want to talk about mental illness""","The statement shows that the speaker is interpreting their feelings of guilt as evidence that they are ""an awful friend."" This equates feeling bad with being a fundamentally bad person in this specific role, thus applying a negative global label to themselves. The person is not just acknowledging a difficult feeling but is labeling their entire character negatively based on their desire to avoid a particular topic. This fits the definition of ""Labeling,"" where one assigns a negative, overly simplistic identity to oneself.",Labeling
689,If others are talking I am always sure they are talking about me and judging me.,If others are talking I am always sure they are talking about me and judging me.,"The statement involves assuming knowledge about others' thoughts without evidence, specifically believing that others are talking about and judging the speaker. This fits the definition of 'Mind Reading,' where one believes they know what others are thinking. While there is a sense of personalization (relating others' behavior directly to oneself), the primary distortion is the assumption about others' thoughts without proof.",Mind Reading
690,I know you’re gonna look at this and make assumptions because I’m a 16 year old girl and I self harm.,I know you’re gonna look at this and make assumptions because I’m a 16 year old girl and I self harm.,"The key phrase indicates a belief the speaker holds about what others will think or assume ('I know you’re gonna look at this and make assumptions'). This reflects the speaker predicting or foreseeing others' judgments without direct evidence. The distortion involves making a negative prediction about others' thoughts based on age and self-harm status, rather than concrete feedback or facts. This fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts a negative outcome or response in advance.",Fortune-telling
691,And I blame myself for all that knowing that I can hurt somebody.,I blame myself for all that knowing that I can hurt somebody,"The statement shows the speaker taking full responsibility ('I blame myself') for a situation that involves potential harm to others. This indicates the speaker is assuming excessive responsibility for events, which is characteristic of Personalization. There is no indication of black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or other listed distortions. The focus is on self-blame related to an external outcome, fitting the definition of Personalization.",Personalization

The speaker interprets the boyfriend’s unspoken feelings or thoughts about potential infidelity based on the location and event, assuming his distrust without direct evidence. This indicates the speaker is inferring or assuming what the boyfriend is thinking without me being explicitly stated. The key distortion here is 'Mind Reading' because the speaker believes they know the boyfriend’s thoughts or feelings without him explicitly expressing them.",Mind Reading

I might have felt this “high”once before but not to this point- especially during finals where most individuals are depressed and stressed.,shifting from severe depression to a kind of mania; I might have felt this “high” once before but not to this point; especially during finals where most individuals are depressed and stressed,"The statement describes an emotional experience (shift from depression to mania) and contrasts it with the typical experience of others during finals (depressed and stressed). The focus is not on predicting the future (fortune-telling), nor is it about absolute categories (all-or-nothing), nor assigning blame or labels. Instead, the speaker emotionally interprets their state in relation to others, implying that their emotions are justified by the context. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are used as evidence of the truth of a situation.",Emotional Reasoning
694,I can’t stop imagining the life I don’t have.,I can’t stop imagining the life I don’t have,"The key phrase indicates the person is fixating on an imagined alternative life that they do not possess. This reflects a cognitive distortion where attention is selectively focused on negative or desired aspects, ignoring current reality. The statement does not involve absolute terms (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), interpreting others' thoughts (Mind Reading), or attributing external events to oneself (Personalization). It is primarily a focus on negative or missing aspects, consistent with 'Mental filter', which involves focusing exclusively on certain negative details or imagined deficits while ignoring broader context.",Mental filter

The physical illness in response to the daughter’s presence shows the emotions are interpreted as reality, equating feeling ill with the presence of triggers. This suggests the person is concluding that their emotional response (resentment, anger, physical illness) accurately reflects reality (the daughter’s presence being harmful or wrong) without objective evidence, which is characteristic of emotional reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
696,"I feel like in our relationship he lacks a lot of respect for me. When the children are not present he will cuss me out when upset, tell me to leave or think of the meanest thing he can say to hurt me.","""he lacks a lot of respect for me"", ""cuss me out when upset"", ""tell me to leave or think of the meanest thing he can say to hurt me""","The statement focuses on specific negative behaviors of the partner (cussing, telling to leave, thinking mean things), and concludes that he lacks a lot of respect. This conclusion appears to be based on concrete evidence rather than an irrational or distorted thought process. There is no clear sign of distortion like exaggerating the behavior (magnification), making absolute judgments (all-or-nothing), predicting the future (fortune-telling), or reading his mind without evidence. The speaker is reporting real actions and the emotional impact they have, which aligns with an accurate appraisal of behavior. Therefore, the thought does not demonstrate a cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
697,It’s been very difficult to process the memories from the childhood experiences because of the shame and guilt I feel for being so needy.,shame and guilt I feel for being so needy,"The statement focuses on intense feelings of shame and guilt about a personal trait ('being so needy'), which indicates self-blaming and negative self-labeling. There is an implicit assigning of a negative label ('needy') to oneself, which reflects how the person interprets their childhood experiences through this critical self-judgment. This aligns most closely with 'Labeling' as the distortion because the speaker is defining themselves by a negative attribute based on their feelings and past experiences.",Labeling
698,I am writing about this panic attack because I am so afraid of developing a psychotic illness. I am afraid that I might have a psychotic break during a panic attack.,I am so afraid of developing a psychotic illness; I am afraid that I might have a psychotic break during a panic attack.,"The statement expresses fear about a future negative event (developing a psychotic illness or having a psychotic break) without evidence that it will happen, effectively predicting a negative outcome. This aligns with the distortion of 'Fortune-telling,' where a person anticipates a negative future event with certainty despite uncertainty.",Fortune-telling
699,At 71 I don’t think her body can take the level the mania is putting her through.,"At 71, her body can’t take the level the mania is putting her through","The statement assumes a negative physical consequence based solely on age and the presence of mania without concrete evidence. It reflects a prediction or assumption about what will happen, implying inevitability or certainty about a future outcome. This fits the cognitive distortion where a person anticipates negative events without proof.",Fortune-telling
700,I felt no emotion whatsoever and said nothing.,"""I felt no emotion whatsoever""","The phrase ""I felt no emotion whatsoever"" reflects an absolute, extreme statement indicating a complete absence of feeling. This shows a binary way of thinking—either feeling something or feeling absolutely nothing—without recognizing any middle ground or nuance. Such black-and-white thinking aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking. There is no evidence of the other distortions such as assuming how others think (Mind Reading), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or emotional reasoning where emotions determine truth. The statement is a strict dichotomy regarding emotional experience.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This indicates a focus on selectively dwelling on negative or specific details repeatedly. The cognitive distortion that involves focusing excessively on a particular single negative detail while ignoring other aspects is known as 'Mental filter'. The statement does not suggest extreme black-and-white thinking, making assumptions about others’ thoughts, predicting the future, assigning labels, or personal blame. It specifically captures filtering attention to constant reminders and rumination.",Mental filter

The phrase 'i feel like' indicates that the feeling is being interpreted as fact, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning—using feelings as proof of reality. Although there is an element of pessimism about future possibilities, there is no clear prediction of specific future outcomes (which would be Fortune-telling). The focus is on the feeling being equated with actual truth about the situation.",Emotional Reasoning

This reflects an all-or-nothing mindset where only one option (playing this game) is perceived as valid for contentment, ignoring other possibilities or alternatives. The person is making a rigid distinction that without this game, they cannot be happy, which aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The concern about 'underlying mental problems' also reflects labeling her character or mental state. The speaker assumes the person doesn't understand or realize the impact of her behavior and that she is making things difficult, which further suggests labeling her personality or mental state in a negative way. There is no evidence of fortune-telling, personalizing, or emotional reasoning as the speaker is not inferring feelings based simply on emotions or assuming the future. The dominant distortion is labeling, where a broad negative label is applied to the individual.",Labeling
705,"And im afraid because i know how bad i feel, and i dont want to be locked away forever.","I'm afraid because I know how bad I feel, and I don't want to be locked away forever.","The statement bases the fear on the current emotional state ('how bad I feel'), assuming that feeling bad directly correlates with a certain reality ('being locked away forever'). This is reasoning from an emotion to a fact without objective evidence, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning. The person is interpreting their feeling of distress as evidence of an inevitable negative outcome.",Emotional Reasoning

They assume a negative outcome will occur (that they can't handle another pregnancy) without evidence that this will definitely happen. This is a classic example of Fortune-telling, where one predicts future negative outcomes with certainty based on current feelings or past difficulties.",Fortune-telling
707,I really need to talk to someone but I fear that they will despise me what is my problem Why do I behaving like a fool?,"""I fear that they will despise me""; ""Why do I behave like a fool?""","The speaker expresses a fear that others will despise them without evidence, suggesting they are assuming to know what others think. This is characteristic of 'Mind Reading,' a cognitive distortion where one believes they can understand others' thoughts or feelings without direct confirmation. While 'Labeling' could relate to calling oneself a 'fool,' the core distortion centers on the assumption about others' negative judgments, which aligns best with 'Mind Reading.'",Mind Reading

Consequently, the speaker feels resigned to just enduring the problem without resolution. The key distortion lies in the speaker's assumption that because of her defensive reaction, there is no possibility to address or solve the issue, implying a rigid and pessimistic conclusion drawn about all future problems. This reflects 'Fortune-telling,' where the individual predicts an inevitable negative outcome without evidence beyond the current emotional reactions.",Fortune-telling

I was in third grade and from that point on, I could not help but break down every other day.","moved schools and was placed in a different environment from an early age; in third grade, from that point on, could not help but break down every other day","The statement suggests that after moving schools and being in a new environment starting from third grade, the person consistently experienced emotional breakdowns every other day. The phrase 'from that point on' implies a pattern that started once an event happened and continued indefinitely. This indicates a broad generalization from a single experience (moving schools and new environment) to an ongoing emotional state (breaking down frequently). This fits the classic definition of overgeneralization, where one negative event or situation is seen as a permanent, pervasive problem affecting all future experiences.",Overgeneralization
710,"I could be walking down a hallway at work, say hello to someone, they look right at me and keep walking. It makes me feel like I could die inside.",someone looks right at me and keeps walking; it makes me feel like I could die inside,"The speaker interprets the other person's behavior (looking at them and not responding) as a deeply personal rejection that leads to intense emotional pain. This interpretation is based solely on the feeling evoked ('makes me feel like I could die inside') rather than objective evidence. The distortion involves using feelings as proof of reality, which matches the definition of Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
711,"I’ve recently been feeling really overwhelmed and just overall down especially about myself. Anytime anyone says a bad thing about me, I feel insanely guilty and burst into tears either right there or later by myself.",feeling really overwhelmed and down about myself; feeling insanely guilty when anyone says a bad thing about me; bursting into tears either immediately or later by myself,"The individual experiences intense emotional responses (guilt, crying) specifically triggered by negative comments from others. They interpret these comments as deeply personal and internalize them, which indicates they are reasoning based on their emotional reaction rather than objective evidence. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as proof of truth. There is no indication of expecting future outcomes (Fortune-telling), extreme dichotomies (All-or-Nothing), or labeling oneself. The core distortion appears to be interpreting feelings (guilt, sadness) as definitive evidence of worth or failure.",Emotional Reasoning
712,I have had panic attacks for 10 years recently they have gotten so much worse and I can’t get through them anymore.   I have severe health anxiety and my heart will go fast for no reason it seems like so now I’m convinced I have A fib and I can’t let it go.,“I have severe health anxiety and my heart will go fast for no reason it seems like so now I’m convinced I have A fib and I can’t let it go.”,"The key phrase shows the individual interprets a fast heartbeat as a direct and certain sign they have atrial fibrillation (A fib), despite no definitive evidence. This is an example of emotional reasoning, where feelings of anxiety and physical sensations are taken as proof of a feared outcome rather than objective facts. The person’s conviction about having A fib stems from their emotional state and bodily sensations rather than medical confirmation.",Emotional Reasoning
713,I have had feelings of doubt and dread the whole time. I feel as though I’m planning my own death instead of my wedding. Any thought or conversation about the wedding makes me sick to my stomache.,feelings of doubt and dread the whole time; planning my own death instead of my wedding; any thought or conversation about the wedding makes me sick to my stomach,"The statement shows a strong emotional response tied directly to thoughts about the wedding. The person interprets their feelings of doubt and dread as being equivalent to planning their own death, a very negative emotional interpretation. They also feel physically sick when thinking about or discussing the wedding. This indicates they are using their negative emotions as evidence that the wedding situation must be hopeless or disastrous. This is consistent with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are used as proof of reality rather than objective evidence.",Emotional Reasoning
714,I cant do anything because i dont want to stress my mother as well. therefore my sister can do what ever she wants.,"""I can't do anything because I don't want to stress my mother""; ""therefore my sister can do whatever she wants""","The statement shows that the speaker believes they must restrict their own actions entirely to avoid causing stress to their mother, which implies a rigid, absolute rule ('I can't do anything'). This is an example of all-or-nothing thinking because the speaker sees the situation in black-and-white terms: either they do nothing (to avoid stressing their mother) or their sister can do whatever she wants. There is no middle ground or nuanced approach considered, which characterizes all-or-nothing thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
715,"I am still a teenager so maybe I am in way over my head, but I am reaching 18 soon, and I fear I will let this part of me consume my being.",I am still a teenager so maybe I am in way over my head; I fear I will let this part of me consume my being.,"The statement involves the belief that because the speaker is still a teenager, they might be overwhelmed or incapable, reflecting a negative expectation about their ability to cope. The phrase 'I fear I will let this part of me consume my being' expresses a prediction about a negative future event without certainty. This aligns with Fortune-telling, where one assumes or predicts negative outcomes without definitive evidence. It is not All-or-Nothing Thinking since there is no extreme either/or scenario directly stated. Emotional Reasoning is not primary here because the focus is on predicting a future event, not necessarily reasoning from feelings alone. Labeling, Magnification, Mental filter, Mind Reading, Personalization, Overgeneralization, and Should statements are not clearly present. Therefore, the best label is Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
716,I’m 16 and I am going through extreme guilt and regret over 3 incidents.   I worry if she would tell her mom and put entire blame on me(as I was the older one) and then they would call the police and I would be called an abuser.,I worry if she would tell her mom and put entire blame on me (as I was the older one) and then they would call the police and I would be called an abuser.,"The statement reflects the individual's worry about what another person might do and what consequences might follow, specifically that the other person would inform her mom, place full blame on the speaker, and result in police involvement labeling the speaker as an abuser. This indicates the speaker is predicting a negative future outcome without certainty. The distortion involves assuming knowledge of future events without evidence, which fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling.' Other distortions such as Mind Reading or Magnification might partially apply, but the focus on anticipating specific negative future events points to Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
717,I’m stuck between my family and my boyfriend and at this point I choose him over them because I see my whole future with him.,I see my whole future with him,"The key phrase indicates the person is predicting a future outcome based on current feelings or beliefs. This reflects anticipating or predicting what will happen without concrete evidence. There is no indication of absolute terms, emotional assumptions, or labeling here. Instead, the statement assumes a specific future scenario, which aligns with forecasting or predicting the future.",Fortune-telling
718,"I’ve been experiencing hallucinations and delusions, mainly delusions. I often see a figure following me around just behind my back, shadows near me, and my delusions include the thought that everything i see is not real, that everyone hates me, that something will eventually come and kill me, even if its not alive, amd much more.  The smallest task can seem like such s pain, and i have also many more things i have experienced.","delusions including the thought that everything I see is not real, that everyone hates me, that something will eventually come and kill me","The statement describes persistent beliefs about reality that are disconnected from actual evidence and involve assumptions about others' feelings (everyone hates me) and future catastrophe (something will come and kill me). These reflect predictions about the future and others’ thoughts without proof. This aligns closest with 'Fortune-telling', as the person is predicting negative outcomes with certainty. Other distortions like Mind Reading could apply, but fortune-telling better encompasses the fearful predictions about future harm, including irrational and catastrophic outcomes.",Fortune-telling
719,"They just can’t seem to comprehend that they don’t have me, their own daughter, figured out.","""They just can’t seem to comprehend""; ""they don’t have me, their own daughter, figured out""","The statement assumes that 'they' (presumably the speaker's parents) are unable to understand or comprehend the speaker fully. This reflects the speaker attributing specific thoughts or knowledge to others without concrete evidence. The phrase suggests the speaker is assuming what others are thinking or feeling about them, fitting the definition of 'Mind Reading'—believing you know what others think without verification.",Mind Reading
720,"I can live happily but sometimes I just got this strong urge to kill someone. It feels like something is dragging me into a void and just takes control of me.   I am afraid of the reactions of my family since I pretended to be something Im not my whole life.

This is reflected in the fear of being discovered or judged, which is a typical symptom of 'Mind Reading'—assuming to know others' thoughts and judgments. Other distortions like Fortune-telling could be considered, but the emphasis is on assumptions about others' mental states rather than future events. Therefore, 'Mind Reading' fits best.",Mind Reading
721,"Hi, I’ve had this problem for 4 months it’s been 24/7, but things have all of a sudden felt like everything is getting like fast forwarded or rushed like I sat in a dressing room for an 1 hour and it felt like 30 minutes I don’t know what’s wrong with my perception of time is there any way to fix this???

There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, personalization, or other distortions. The person is expressing confusion and concern about their current perception and emotional state rather than distorting reality through a cognitive filter. Therefore, no cognitive distortion is being demonstrated here; it's more of a factual report of subjective experience.",No Distortion
722,And kinda of secretly and slightly irrationally I’m dating her in my head. & I sounds crazy… I feel crazy for wanting to live this out in my head but I equally feel like it’s a better rebound then another fucked up relationship.,"""secretly and slightly irrationally I’m dating her in my head"", ""I sounds crazy… I feel crazy for wanting to live this out in my head"", ""it’s a better rebound then another fucked up relationship""","The speaker acknowledges that their behavior is ""irrational"" and labels themselves as ""crazy"" for their thoughts. This is a direct example of labeling, where the person assigns a negative label to themselves based on a single thought or behavior. The phrase ""I feel crazy"" demonstrates emotional reasoning, but the core distortion is labeling because the statement expresses an internal negative judgment or label about themselves. The comparison of this mental scenario to a ""better rebound"" reflects a subjective evaluation but does not necessarily indicate other distortions like fortune-telling or all-or-nothing thinking.",Labeling
723,If I don’t wake up angry something small may happen and I’m mad for the entire day.,"""If I don’t wake up angry"", ""something small may happen and I’m mad for the entire day""","The statement predicts a future outcome (something small happening) based on a current condition (not waking up angry), and assumes that if this happens, the emotional response (being mad all day) is certain. This involves predicting a negative event and its emotional consequence without concrete evidence, reflecting a belief about the future outcome that is assumed to be true. The key element is the anticipation or prediction of a negative event occurring.",Fortune-telling

The person believes they are unable to make decisions independently and consistently relies on others for choices. This indicates a broad conclusion about their own capability, formed from multiple situations across different contexts (school, friendships). This pattern reflects overgeneralizing a single trait (inability to decide or be alone) across various life areas.",Overgeneralization
725,"I sort of want to bring the idea up to my mom, but I don’t want her to judge me.",I don’t want her to judge me,"The statement expresses a fear of being judged by the mom without any evidence provided. The speaker is assuming they know what the mom will think or feel about the idea, which is a classic example of 'Mind Reading'—believing one can know another person's thoughts or judgments without factual support.",Mind Reading
726,"I know this isn’t normal, or right, but I’ve been wanting to kill someone recently, and in very graphic ways, even thinking of torturing them before I do it.","‘I know this isn’t normal, or right’, ‘I’ve been wanting to kill someone recently’, ‘thinking of torturing them before I do it’","The statement expresses a strong judgment about the thought of killing someone, labeling the desire as 'not normal' and 'not right.' The person acknowledges the disturbing nature of these thoughts but does not generalize to other areas or predict the future outcome, which would suggest other distortions like overgeneralization or fortune-telling. The focus is on the labeling of the thoughts themselves as abnormal or wrong rather than an emotional judgment about feelings or magnifying consequences. Therefore, the primary distortion appears to be labeling, where the self or thoughts are identified with a negative term instead of recognizing them as transient or separate mental events.",Labeling
727,"However, I worry that I’m not being as loving towards her as I feel I should be.",I worry that I’m not being as loving towards her as I feel I should be,"The phrase 'I feel I should be' indicates the presence of a self-imposed standard or expectation about how one ought to behave. This reflects the cognitive distortion known as 'Should statements,' where individuals impose rigid rules or demands on themselves (or others), often leading to feelings of guilt or worry if these standards are perceived as unmet. The statement is not about predicting the future (Fortune-telling), interpreting emotions as truth (Emotional Reasoning), nor making absolute judgments (All-or-Nothing Thinking). It also does not involve exaggeration (Magnification), filtering, labeling, mind reading, or personalization. Therefore, the most fitting distortion is 'Should statements.'",Should statements

They expect ridicule and derogatory remarks before even asking for help, which reflects predicting the future with certainty without evidence about the current situation. This matches the distortion type of Fortune-telling, where the person predicts a negative outcome in advance.",Fortune-telling

This is a form of expecting a negative outcome with certainty, aligning with the distortion of Fortune-telling. Additionally, the speaker assumes therapy and thinking won’t help based on current feelings rather than objective evidence. There is also a tendency to interpret current emotional state as a fact, but the dominant distortion is the anticipation of an inevitably negative future.",Fortune-telling

Despite these positive facts, the person focuses on the loss of a specific future opportunity (growing old with someone they really loved). This focus represents a mental filter cognitive distortion, where the individual highlights a single negative aspect and filters out the broader positive context.",Mental filter

This shows an internal pressure on how emotions should be based on circumstances. This aligns most closely with 'Should statements' where the individual is implicitly stating they 'should not' feel sad given their life situation. The confusion about what is wrong and self-alienation indicate emotional struggle but do not point directly to other distortions like mind reading or labeling. Therefore, the primary distortion is an internalized 'should' about emotional validity.",Should statements

This statement generalizes the current experience by comparing it broadly to all previous obsessions.

734,We had an argument with our teenage son who was rude and insolent.,argument with teenage son; son was rude and insolent,"The statement describes the son's behavior using negative labels ('rude' and 'insolent'). This involves attaching a negative global label to the son based on a specific event (the argument). There is no evidence of thinking in absolutes, predicting the future, or other distortions. The key distortion is labeling, as the son's character is defined by these specific traits within the context.",Labeling
735,Hurting myself to gain attention seems stupid and childish…,Hurting myself to gain attention seems stupid and childish,"The statement involves a negative evaluation of the behavior ('stupid and childish'). This evaluation assigns a harsh, global label to the action without nuance. The speaker is categorizing the behavior under a negative label, which fits the definition of Labeling, where one assigns a fixed, negative label to oneself or an action based on limited evidence. It is not All-or-Nothing Thinking, as there is no extreme either/or assessment. It is not Emotional Reasoning, as it doesn't rely solely on feelings as evidence. It is not Fortune-telling or Mind Reading, as it does not predict future events or assume others' thoughts. It is also not Should statements or the other distortions. Therefore, Labeling is the most appropriate distortion classification.",Labeling

They spend extensive time searching and experiencing pain over the lack, which suggests an emotional basis for their reasoning. The distress seems derived from their feelings, not just objective evidence. This suggests they are reasoning based on their emotional state rather than rational evaluation. The key is the reliance on feelings ('its almost hurting') to justify beliefs or actions, fitting Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

This aligns with 'Mind Reading,' where one assumes they know what another person is thinking or feeling. The emotional responses ('My heart hurts,' 'I cry way too much,' and 'I am losing confidence in me') are consequences of this assumption rather than objectively stated facts. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling about the future, magnification, labeling, or other distortions in this specific statement.

744,I also developed an intense fear of not being included or of someone else being chosen over me.,intense fear of not being included; fear of someone else being chosen over me,"The statement reflects a strong expectation or prediction about future social rejection or exclusion without clear evidence. The person assumes a negative social outcome will happen (not being included or being rejected in favor of someone else), which aligns with predicting the future negatively. It does not reflect all-or-nothing thinking (no extremes presented), emotional reasoning (it states fear but does not conclude truth based solely on feelings), labeling, or the other listed distortions. The main distortion is the assumption about a negative future event occurring, which fits 'Fortune-telling'.",Fortune-telling
745,"I think it’s odd considering that I am a female, and women are supposed to be really emotional people.","I am a female, and women are supposed to be really emotional people.","The statement generalizes that all women (including the speaker) are supposed to be very emotional.

This suggests the person is interpreting the situation primarily through their emotional response, rather than an objective assessment of the situation. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, mind reading, or other distortions. The person is concluding that the presence of family members leads to an intensely aversive experience based on their feelings.

This suggests a pattern of viewing experiences as uniformly negative without exceptions. The reflection on whether the other person is abusive or if they're overreacting shows some doubt but is secondary to the overarching negative generalization about the relationship.

752,Anyway these sexual play encounters have really plagued my with tremendous guilt recently.,these sexual play encounters have really plagued me with tremendous guilt recently,"The phrase indicates the individual feels overwhelmed by guilt due to certain encounters. The word 'plagued' and 'tremendous guilt' suggests an exaggeration or amplification of negative feelings related to the events. This is consistent with magnification, where one blows a negative aspect out of proportion. There is no indication of absolute thinking, labeling, or predicting the future, so other distortions are less applicable.",Magnification

The phrase 'it seems like my emotions have been going haywire' indicates that the person's current emotional state is interpreted as evidence of a problem, implying that emotions are being used as a gauge of reality (emotional reasoning). The person is concluding that because they feel emotionally unstable, something must be wrong overall. There is no clear evidence of other distortions such as overgeneralization or all-or-nothing thinking. The main distortion is interpreting emotional state as proof of actual deterioration.",Emotional Reasoning
755,"Once I start thinking, I think about every single problem in my life and I cry.","Once I start thinking, I think about every single problem in my life and I cry.","The key phrase 'every single problem in my life' indicates a tendency to consider all problems at once without exception. This suggests an overgeneralization, where one instance or thought leads the person to think about all related problems collectively. The reaction of crying supports the emotional impact but doesn't change the distortion type. The distortion isn't about all-or-nothing thinking (which involves black-and-white reasoning), emotional reasoning (which involves concluding something is true because one feels it), or other distortions like fortune-telling or labeling. The focus is on overgeneralizing from thinking about one problem to encompassing all problems.",Overgeneralization

This inference is drawn from the perceived emotional turmoil rather than objective evidence of his thinking process. The key phrase indicates a conclusion about someone's thoughts derived from emotional understanding rather than direct knowledge, fitting the definition of Mind Reading, where one assumes they know another person's thoughts without explicit communication.",Mind Reading

This makes me seem kinda dumb and crazy.","Ever since the day I was born, I’ve always had problems expressing my thoughts and getting out what I wanted to say. This makes me seem kinda dumb and crazy.","The statement suggests a long-term and absolute conclusion about the person's ability ('Ever since the day I was born, I’ve always had problems...'), which indicates an overgeneralization—applying a specific difficulty across their entire life without exception. Additionally, the person labels themselves negatively based on this difficulty ('makes me seem kinda dumb and crazy'), which strongly indicates the use of labeling by assigning a negative global trait based on one aspect of their behavior. Between overgeneralization and labeling, labeling is more dominant here because the key cognitive distortion is assigning a negative global identity based on the difficulty.",Labeling
758,"My ex and I broke up a month ago b/c he was a cheater and I found out many instances where he wasn’t faithful to me in our relationship-we were together for a year off and on (he flew out to visit ex g/f in cali and told me he was going mtn biking, emailed/chatted with Transexuals online, emailed girls on myspace, craigslist, dating websites etc).","He was a cheater; I found many instances where he wasn’t faithful (flying out to visit ex-girlfriend but lying, emailing/chating with transsexuals and girls on Myspace, Craigslist, dating websites).","The statement highlights multiple specific instances of infidelity and deceit, leading the speaker to conclude definitively that the partner was a cheater. There is a broad generalization from specific acts of unfaithfulness to a fixed negative label for the entire relationship and person. This indicates a pattern of concluding a definitive and global judgment (cheater) based on several incidents, which fits the definition of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

The reasoning relies heavily on feelings to draw a conclusion about reality, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning. They are interpreting their emotional state (increasing anxiety) as evidence of an uncontrollable and damaging truth.",Emotional Reasoning
760,"She has completely shattered my confidence, that I don’t speak much anymore.","She has completely shattered my confidence, that I don’t speak much anymore.","The phrase 'She has completely shattered my confidence' suggests the person attributes a large impact on their self-confidence directly to one individual’s actions. The result is 'I don’t speak much anymore,' showing a behavioral change linked to this event. The key cognitive distortion here involves assuming a global negative impact on oneself from a single event or interaction. This indicates an overgeneralization, where one experience or interaction leads to a broad conclusion about the self ('I don’t speak much anymore'). This is more than emotional reasoning because it is not just a feeling driving the thought, but a sweeping conclusion drawn from a single instance.",Overgeneralization
761,"This helped me a great deal while I was doing both of those things however, I chose to stop them both as I made myself believe I didn’t need them.",I made myself believe I didn’t need them,"The phrase indicates that the person convinced themselves of a belief ('I didn’t need them') rather than basing the decision on objective evidence or facts. This suggests a cognitive distortion where feelings or internal belief are treated as truth without clear evidence, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning. Emotional Reasoning involves assuming that because we feel a certain way, it must be true. The statement does not imply extremes (all-or-nothing), nor predictive judgments (fortune-telling), nor labeling, etc. Instead, the key distortion lies in self-generated belief not grounded in evidence, consistent with Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
762,I’ll do crazy and spontaneous stuff because of it and I’ll also get heavily paranoid.,do crazy and spontaneous stuff; get heavily paranoid,"The statement anticipates specific negative reactions ('crazy and spontaneous stuff' and 'heavily paranoid') as a direct consequence of some cause. This shows predicting future outcomes without evidence, which aligns with expecting negative events or feelings to happen in the future. This fits the 'Fortune-telling' distortion, where someone predicts something bad will occur without proof.",Fortune-telling

They interpret the friend's anger as a personal failure or fault, leading to self-punishment. This indicates they personalize the emotional state of others, assuming it directly reflects their own worth or actions. While there is emotional reasoning involved in the anxiety, the core distortion is personalizing the event, blaming themselves excessively for others' reactions.",Personalization

I feel like everyone is taking advantage of me because sometimes I forget things.,"""he wants to make me feel like I am a bad sibling"", ""everyone is taking advantage of me because sometimes I forget things""","The statement reflects a belief that because the speaker sometimes forgets things, everyone is taking advantage of them. This is an overgeneralization from specific incidents (forgetting things) to a universal conclusion (everyone taking advantage). Additionally, the phrase 'he wants to make me feel like I am a bad sibling' suggests a possible perception of blame and negative labeling, but the main distortion lies in the broad negative conclusion drawn about all others based on limited evidence.",Overgeneralization
766,I know the stuff the stalker said hurt him because he thought it was hurting me.,"""he thought it was hurting me""","The statement assumes knowledge of another person's thoughts or intentions without direct evidence.

This indicates the speaker is inferring the family's thoughts or feelings without direct evidence, assuming they hold a specific belief or attitude towards the speaker's emotional state. This fits the definition of 'Mind Reading,' which involves believing one knows what others are thinking or feeling without clear proof. The other distortions do not fit as precisely: it’s not a case of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or fortune-telling, and there are no explicit 'should' statements or labeling.",Mind Reading

The phrase 'just failure after failure' indicates that the person is taking multiple experiences and categorizing all of life as failures without exceptions or nuance. This is indicative of overgeneralization, where one or two events (or a series of events) are seen as a never-ending pattern affecting the whole. Additionally, there is an implied hopelessness about the future, but the core distortion is the sweeping conclusion about life as a whole.",Overgeneralization
769,"But just a few days ago, when his family called me (after nearly a month or so), I immediately started to shake and experience these feelings again.",I immediately started to shake and experience these feelings again,"The key phrase describes an internal emotional and physical reaction ('started to shake and experience these feelings again') that is used as evidence to validate the reality or truth of the situation. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the individual believes that because they feel a certain way, it must be true or that the situation is definitely threatening or negative. There is no evidence of other distortions such as predicting the future (Fortune-telling), black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), or assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading) in the statement.",Emotional Reasoning

It suggests a sweeping conclusion about life fairness and desires that applies universally from a single experience. This aligns with overgeneralization, where a single event or observation leads to a broad, often negative conclusion about life or oneself.",Overgeneralization

There’s no in between for me.","I always worry about being abandoned even when there are no signs; if someone leaves, I feel it’s my fault and have suicidal thoughts; my emotions swing between really happy and sadness with no in-between.","The statement reveals a pattern of all-or-nothing thinking in the emotional experiences described ('no in between for me'), indicating black-and-white thinking with no middle ground. The intense worry about abandonment despite no evidence points to exaggeration but does not explicitly fit Fortune-telling or Mind Reading. Feeling the departure is entirely the person's fault aligns with Personalization, but the phrase emphasizing extreme emotional swings and no middle ground strongly emphasizes All-or-Nothing Thinking. Therefore, the dominant distortion is the dichotomous perception of emotions and relationships, which best matches All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This is an instance of fortune-telling, where the individual assumes a catastrophic event will happen. The justification about being underage supports the perceived inability, but the core distortion lies in anticipating a dire future event.",Fortune-telling

776,These thoughts are very painful and disturbing and I do not know how to deal with them.,thoughts are very painful and disturbing; do not know how to deal with them,"The statement expresses distress caused by certain thoughts and an inability to manage them. The primary focus is on the emotional experience (pain and disturbance) related to these thoughts. There is no evidence that the person is making absolute judgments (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or applying negative labels to themselves or others (Labeling). The emphasis is on feelings to validate the reality of the situation, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning — believing something is true based on how one feels rather than objective evidence.",Emotional Reasoning

There is an implicit assumption that the cause of such behavior must be known or explainable for the speaker to feel comfortable. This shows reliance on their emotional state ('shocked') to interpret the situation, as if the shock justifies or compels needing an explanation. However, the statement does not present a distorted thought pattern like assuming certainty about the future (fortune-telling) or labeling a person negatively. It mainly reflects emotional reasoning, where feelings are used as evidence to explain or evaluate the event.",Emotional Reasoning

There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking or labeling, nor is there fortune-telling or emotional reasoning dominating the statement. The difficulty staying at home is an expression of feeling overwhelmed but does not introduce a different cognitive distortion. Hence, the most accurate cognitive distortion type here is Personalization.",Personalization

This reflects 'mind reading', as the speaker is attributing motives and emotions to others. Moreover, the phrase 'I’m the one they call only when they need something' generalizes the situation to all interactions, implying a broad negative pattern. However, the primary distortion is the assumption about others' internal states without proof, matching mind reading more directly than overgeneralization or other distortions.",Mind Reading

The repeated failure to meet these expectations results in feelings of emptiness and procrastination. This reflects internal pressure and self-imposed rules about how one 'should' behave. The phrase 'I know I have to...' and planning to start tomorrow indicates a focus on rules and expectations rather than accepting current realities. This pattern aligns with 'Should statements' because the person is driven by rigid ideas about what they must do, causing distress and a cycle of procrastination.",Should statements

The phrase 'i have more doctors than friends' suggests a broad comparison implying a lack of friends; 'my family is disgusted' assumes the family's feelings without explicit evidence (mind reading); 'the only people i talk to...' emphasizes isolation; 'my friends all go to school hours (if not states) away' generalizes the distance and lack of physical proximity. The speaker is applying one negative detail about their situation to their entire social life and overall enjoyment, rather than seeing nuances or exceptions. This points to overgeneralization, as one or a few negative elements are used to judge the entirety of their social and emotional life.",Overgeneralization

The use of 'always' and 'nothing but' suggests an absolute, without acknowledging any nuance or variability before the past year. This reflects an all-or-nothing perspective, where the relationship is seen as either completely positive or suffering without middle ground. The mention of 'hard times' recently points to a change, but the distortion lies in the absolute positive characterization of the entire prior period.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

Over two years, their activities have been significantly limited to a few functions like going to the theater, grocery store, and medical appointments. The decision to stop searching for a therapist and focus on school suggests a feeling of defeat or resignation. However, the speaker does not make absolute statements about their entire future or self-worth, nor do they assign labels, magnify a single event, or make predictions.

The guilt being felt is an emotional response that the person assumes must reflect something inherently wrong with them or their choices, despite external factors and valid reasons affecting the situation. This reflects personalization, as the person is taking responsibility and blame for outcomes that are not entirely their fault.",Personalization
797,I feel like he really hates me at those moments.,"""he really hates me at those moments""","The statement reflects an assumption about what another person thinks or feels, without direct evidence.

This indicates a cognitive distortion where the person views their abilities and self-worth in an all-encompassing negative manner without middle ground.

The worry about these outcomes and the difficulty in stopping worry shows a pattern of expecting negative events to occur. This fits with the cognitive distortion of Fortune-telling, where one assumes a negative outcome will happen despite uncertainty.",Fortune-telling

Additionally, the speaker assumes a definite and negative outcome without certainty ('she would send me somewhere' and 'I probably kill her if she did'), showing a tendency to predict catastrophic events. However, the strongest cognitive distortion here appears in the absoluteness of the destructive urge and the assumption of an inevitable negative outcome, aligning most closely with 'Fortune-telling' because the speaker predicts a certain future negative event ('she would send me somewhere', 'I probably kill her') without factual basis or proof. There is also an element of catastrophic forecasting. 'Emotional reasoning' might be partially present, but the key distortion is the assumption of negative future events as definite outcomes.",Fortune-telling

I can’t stop no matter how hard I try.,"The statement contains a global label about the self ('I am a compulsive liar') based on behaviors that are described as occurring frequently or habitually. The phrase 'I have always done it' suggests that the speaker is generalizing one trait across their entire life and identity. This is a classic example of labeling, which involves assigning a fixed, global negative label to oneself based on specific behaviors. While there is some exaggeration and emotional reasoning, the core distortion here is the overarching negative self-label.",Labeling
802,"Empathy is difficult for me, I find that I have to force emotions out of myself to at least appear sane to others.","Empathy is difficult for me, I have to force emotions out of myself to at least appear sane to others.","The statement expresses a perception that the person struggles to naturally feel or express empathy and emotions, indicating a difficulty that feels absolute and unchangeable ('difficult for me', 'have to force'). They conclude they need to force emotions just to 'appear sane,' implying a black-and-white view of their emotional ability and social acceptability. This reflects an 'all-or-nothing' mindset where either they are fully empathetic and sane naturally or they must artificially force it, with no middle ground. It is not emotional reasoning because the person is not concluding truth based on feelings; it is not mind reading or other distortions due to lack of assumptions about others’ thoughts or predicting the future.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

It also assumes understanding of others' thoughts and feelings toward the self (believing others think they are unwanted), which is a form of mind reading. There are self-labels such as 'pathetic', 'childish', 'vapid', and 'dull', but these serve as descriptions rather than the primary distortion. The dominant theme throughout is the prediction of negative social interactions and outcomes (conversations will be laughed at, voice telling not to approach people because not wanted), which aligns closely with fortune-telling (predicting negative future events as certain).",Fortune-telling

This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where feelings or emotional states are taken as evidence of reality or fact.

They interpret these sensations as their mind 'not able to process anymore' and feeling like it is 'going to explode.' However, they acknowledge that externally, there's 'no headache' and objective abilities like reading or writing are normal. This indicates the speaker is inferring an internal state based primarily on their emotional and physical feelings rather than objective evidence. This matches the definition of Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as evidence of truth (e.g., 'I feel overwhelmed, so my brain must be overloaded and unable to function'). There is no clear evidence of other distortions such as catastrophizing (magnification) or overgeneralization. The key distortion stems from equating subjective feeling with objective truth.",Emotional Reasoning

These are indicative of thinking in black-and-white or absolute terms rather than a balanced perspective. Although there are elements of emotional reasoning ('I remind myself I don't deserve to feel happy'), the dominant distortion is the extreme, polarized thinking about self-worth, relationships, and emotions.

These are indicative of an all-or-nothing or black-and-white thinking pattern, where situations are viewed as completely hopeless or utterly negative without consideration of any middle ground or positive aspects.

This indicates a generalization from repeated behavior to a broad, pervasive conclusion. They emphasize the continuous nature of the behavior without contextual limitation. This suggests an overgeneralization, where a single behavior or episode is generalized to a never-ending pattern or identity.

This indicates a form of blaming external people or circumstances for not acting, rather than internalizing or personalizing the cause. It does not present an all-or-nothing view, or assuming others’ thoughts (mind reading), nor is it emotional reasoning or fortune-telling.

Phrases like 'maybe thinks im annoying' and 'feels like no one likes me' indicate assuming how others perceive them. This fits the definition of Mind Reading, where one believes they know what others think, usually negatively, without facts.

They report yearly episodes and describe an extreme behavior from one year, indicating a tendency to view the problem as progressively severe without considering any exceptions or fluctuations.

This points to focusing solely on negative details (bad grades, no praise), ignoring any possible neutral or positive aspects. The phrase ""He gives everyone bad grades all the time and never praises us"" reveals a selective focus on negative aspects (mental filter).

They focus on a recent relapse (driving drunk 4 months ago) and conclude that there has never been a consistent change. The phrase 'there hasn’t been a time where he has consistently shown a change because little things like that keep happening' indicates a generalized conclusion drawn from specific setbacks. This is not simply magnifying a single incident but broadening the judgment to cover the entire time period without change despite possibly positive moments.

The speaker weighs actions based on presumed consequences or requirements (e.g., needing to 'back up my story' and revealing identities), reflecting conditional logic and potential black-and-white perspectives on forgiveness and acceptance. However, the statement does not generalize broadly, read others' minds, or make exaggerated statements about outcomes. The emphasis is on dichotomous thinking about acceptance vs. acquiescence and the perceived necessity for certain conditions before action.

EXACTLY a week later the person dies.",I get a dream warning me to treat a person right; a week later the person dies.,"The statement involves predicting a specific future event (the person's death) based on a dream, implying the person believes the dream foretells an inevitable outcome. This is consistent with 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts negative outcomes without evidence. The focus is on expecting a particular future event rather than interpreting emotions or assigning blame.",Fortune-telling

831,She is acting out in school almost every day. She even talks back to adults. I have lost control.,"""acting out in school almost every day"", ""talks back to adults"", ""I have lost control""","The phrase ""almost every day"" suggests a frequency-based conclusion drawn from multiple instances, which points to a pattern. The statement ""I have lost control"" indicates a perception that the situation is completely out of control based on these behaviors. This reflects a tendency to generalize specific instances to an overarching failure or state. The thinking here extends from specific behaviors to a broad, sweeping conclusion about control, which aligns with overgeneralization rather than absolute 'all-or-nothing' or labeling. It is not emotional reasoning because the conclusion is about control, not how the person feels. It is not mind reading or fortune-telling because it does not involve inferring others' thoughts or predicting future events. Therefore, overgeneralization fits best because the speaker generalizes multiple behaviors into a total loss of control.",Overgeneralization

Additionally, the phrase 'it’s always my fault' suggests a pattern of generalizing one event's fault to many situations. The phrase 'I should die' also indicates harsh self-judgment, reflecting the use of 'should statements.' However, the core distortion is the attribution of fault to oneself beyond reasonable evidence, which aligns most closely with Personalization — taking responsibility for something that may not fully be their fault or blaming themselves disproportionately. Other distortions like 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' or 'Overgeneralization' could be partly present, but given the heavy self-blaming content, Personalization is the most fitting single label.",Personalization

Additionally, ""I know they will say I am stupid for doing it"" reflects an assumption about how others will think without direct evidence, which could suggest Mind Reading.

This corresponds to the cognitive distortion of Personalization, where one assumes they are the cause of negative events without considering other factors. The other parts of the statement ('I am devastated', 'I love him', 'I feel guilty') reflect feelings but do not indicate other cognitive distortions such as Emotional Reasoning or Mind Reading.",Personalization

These are factual observations rather than generalizations, exaggerations, or assumptions about intent or future events. The speaker is labeling the husband's behavior in a negative way, applying a global negative descriptor ('violent') and character judgments ('unpredictable') based on these actions. This suggests the distortion is 'Labeling,' where the person's actions lead to assigning a fixed negative label to their character.",Labeling

This involves an internal questioning of whether their perceptions are accurate or imagined. This fits with the distortion of 'Emotional Reasoning,' where feelings (uncertainty, self-punishment) are assumed to reflect objective truth, leading the person to believe that their negative feelings indicate that their thoughts must be false or self-inflicted.

Additionally, they minimize their own problem as unimportant, which fits within this cognitive distortion because they are interpreting others' potential reactions and their own problem’s significance inaccurately.",Mind Reading

The focus is on one or a few negative details (missed dinner, missed weekend, no returned calls) overshadowing the entire relationship experience. The term 'the glitch' suggests a mental filter where the negative aspects are highlighted and dominate perception, ignoring other positive experiences. There is no indication of assuming others' thoughts (mind reading), no extreme all-or-nothing phrasing beyond 'perfect story' being disrupted, and no direct emotional reasoning or predictions about the future. Thus, the dominant distortion is filtering out the positive and focusing solely on negative details.",Mental filter

This reflects predicting failure or embarrassment before it happens, based on an assumption rather than evidence. The distortion involves expecting future negative events to occur, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling.' It is not all-or-nothing since it refers to various possible mistakes, not a single extreme outcome. It’s not emotional reasoning because the statement explicitly expresses fear rather than assuming something is true based on feelings. It is different from mind reading or labeling, as it focuses on the person's own anticipated actions rather than others' thoughts or assigning fixed labels. There is also no 'should' statement involved.",Fortune-telling

The use of words like 'never' and 'practically everything' indicates an extreme generalization from specific events. This suggests the speaker is making a broad conclusion based on limited instances, which aligns with overgeneralization rather than focusing on isolated incidents or objective facts.

It generalizes this condition as a permanent state ('for a long time now'), and contrasts the speaker's lack of desires with others' dreams. This reflects an overgeneralization where a specific emotional state (feeling empty and unmotivated) is extended broadly to conclusions about life and happiness as a whole.

This reflects the assumption that one knows what others are thinking negatively. The focus is on interpreting others' thoughts without confirmation, which is characteristic of Mind Reading cognitive distortion. There is no indication of broader overgeneralization, black-and-white thinking, or should statements; the key distortion lies in assuming knowledge of others' negative judgments.",Mind Reading

This is based on an emotional reaction (being scared) influencing the belief that communication is not possible. The second sentence describes an emotional reaction (crying) triggered by reading about depression, attributed to 'no reason,' which suggests emotions are driving the perception rather than an objective reality. Both phrases demonstrate reasoning driven by feelings rather than facts, which aligns with the distortion known as Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

This is used as evidence of imminent danger or loss of control, despite no direct factual confirmation. The individual is reasoning from their emotional state ('scared') to conclude that something dangerous or catastrophic must be happening. This is a classic case of Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as proof of reality regardless of objective facts.",Emotional Reasoning
878,I still see his face yelling those things to me till this day.,I still see his face yelling those things to me till this day.,"The phrase indicates a persistent emotional experience where the person visualizes and feels the emotional impact of someone yelling at them, even though the yelling is not currently happening. This suggests that the person is basing their feelings on their emotional state or memories rather than objective facts. The statement reflects an emotional response driving their perception, consistent with Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
879,"For a very, very long time – about 4 years now – I’ve been certain I have a personality disorder.","For a very, very long time – about 4 years now – I’ve been certain I have a personality disorder.","The statement shows that the person has been certain for a long duration about having a personality disorder. This certainty over an extended period without fluctuating suggests rigid labeling of themselves with a negative identity rather than objectively evaluating their traits or behavior. The phrase 'I’ve been certain I have a personality disorder' reflects self-identification using a diagnostic label, which aligns with the cognitive distortion called 'Labeling' where one assigns a fixed, negative label to oneself.",Labeling

This indicates that they are attempting to foresee or predict an uncertain future outcome (the diagnosis) without having concrete information yet. There is no indication of all-or-nothing extremes, personal blame, or rigid 'should' statements.

Instead of attributing the fit issues to the external situation or the helper, they assume all the blame lies with themselves by 'chalking it up to my issues.' This self-blame reflects the cognitive distortion of Personalization, where one assumes undue responsibility for events or outcomes that are likely influenced by external factors.",Personalization

Our sex life is almost inexistant.","The statement acknowledges that there are some difficulties but they are usually resolved by communication, which shows a balanced view. The focus then shifts to a current problem: a loss of desire and a nearly nonexistent sex life. The speaker is stating observable facts without jumping to conclusions or making extreme generalizations. There is no evidence of an absolute all-or-nothing perspective, exaggerated negativity, assumptions about the partner's thoughts (mind reading), or attributing blame personally. The statement is largely factual and not based on emotional reasoning or future predictions. Thus, it does not fit typical cognitive distortions and represents a realistic appraisal of the situation.",No Distortion

They also strongly label themselves with harsh negative terms from the past, which reflects labeling. However, the predominant cognitive distortion is predicting frightening future outcomes (obsession, hurting) and doubting the reality of self, fitting fortune-telling. While labeling is present, the fear of negative future events and assuming they will happen without actual proof is central to fortune-telling. Therefore, the main distortion is Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

This anticipates a negative future event without certainty. This aligns with predicting negative outcomes in the future, which corresponds with the distortion type 'Fortune-telling'. There is no indication of magnification in perceiving the intensity, no labeling of self or others, no black-and-white thinking, or emotional reasoning based purely on feelings rather than facts.",Fortune-telling

The use of strong, absolute terms like 'hate' and 'worthless' point to labeling, where the individual assigns a global negative label to themselves based on certain thoughts or feelings. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking about events, nor predicting the future (fortune-telling), nor focusing on just one negative detail (mental filter), nor interpreting feelings as facts (emotional reasoning).

This reflects predicting a negative future without sufficient evidence, which aligns with the distortion of 'Fortune-telling.'

893,Many people love to be around me and I have never had a problem socially and can get along with just about anyone.,Many people love to be around me; I have never had a problem socially; can get along with just about anyone.,"The statement highlights positive social experiences and generalizes them broadly ('many people', 'never had a problem', 'just about anyone'). It extrapolates from past and present experiences to make a sweeping claim about the speaker's social abilities. This is a classic case of overgeneralization, where a specific set of positive experiences is applied universally. There is no distortion towards negativity or extreme thinking, but rather an expansive general statement based on past evidence.",Overgeneralization
894,"i think university (stress, having no passion towards my degree, feelings of inadequacy) is a very huge trigger.","university (stress, having no passion towards my degree, feelings of inadequacy) is a very huge trigger","The statement identifies university as a significant trigger due to stress, lack of passion, and feelings of inadequacy, emphasizing the intensity of the negative impact. This reflects an exaggerated perception of difficulty or threat, which aligns with magnifying the negative aspects. There is no indication of absolute extremes (all-or-nothing), predicting future outcomes (fortune-telling), interpreting others' thoughts (mind reading), or making broad generalizations.

This reasoning is based on how they feel emotionally rather than objective facts, which indicates that their feelings dictate their belief about the situation (wishing to be dead because of feelings of despair). There is no evidence of absolute thinking (all-or-nothing), predicting the future (fortune-telling), or blaming others (personalization). The core distortion lies in believing that the emotional suffering itself proves the reality of the situation, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

This is an example of labeling, where a global negative label is assigned to someone based on specific behaviors. Additionally, the speaker shows fear about leaving due to possible harm but that reflects a realistic concern rather than a distortion. The primary distortion is assigning a permanent, negative character label rather than considering complexities or exceptions.",Labeling

I want to enjoy life again rather than thinking of it as “just having to get through it”.,"""want to live my life without all of the negative thoughts and worries"", ""want to enjoy life again"", ""rather than thinking of it as ‘just having to get through it’""","The speaker expresses a desire to eliminate all negative thoughts and worries completely, implying a wish for a life without any negativity. This reflects an 'all-or-nothing' perspective where life is either enjoyed fully or endured through negativity, without any middle ground. There is no indication of assuming future events (fortune-telling), labeling oneself or others, or other types of distortions. Instead, the key distortion here is the polarized thinking about life experiences.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

I wanted to scream, I wanted to cut, I wanted to burn my entire house down even if it meant death to my whole family just so I could die in it – but that’s not me.","The statement highlights an intense emotional experience and impulses but concludes with a self-judgment: 'but that’s not me.' This indicates the individual is recognizing that despite these extreme urges, their identity does not align with acting on them. The distortion involves interpreting the presence of these feelings and impulses as definitive of the self or as absolute in nature. However, the key cognitive error here is the implied categorization of self through extreme and absolute terms, which aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking—a pattern where something is seen as entirely one way or completely opposite, with no middle ground.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The statement ""these incurable, negative symptoms"" reflects a fixed, absolute conclusion about the prognosis, which also aligns with overgeneralization, as it takes a situation and concludes it applies broadly and unchangeably. The focus on a fixed negative outcome and a sweeping conclusion about personal relationships fits best with overgeneralization rather than other distortions like labeling or emotional reasoning.",Overgeneralization

This leads to feelings of wanting to avoid social interactions and experiencing depression. The core issue is the emotional response ('this repels me', 'depresses me') to an external event, and the speaker treats these feelings as evidence of reality ('it makes me not want to be around friends/loved ones'). This fits the pattern of Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are used to infer facts or truths about situations.",Emotional Reasoning

904,"It caused me to hate my parents, and instead of being sorry for anything, it always made me more hateful and revenge-seeking.","""hate my parents"", ""instead of being sorry for anything, it always made me more hateful and revenge-seeking""","The statement reflects a strong emotional response and a stable negative belief about the parents' behavior or character, leading to hate and revenge. The phrase ""always made me more hateful and revenge-seeking"" indicates a generalization from a presumably specific event or experience to a broad, ongoing emotional stance.

The phrase 'she took it the wrong way, as if it was manipulative and blaming her' reflects that the speaker believes the other person's reaction is based on an assumed intention that may not exist. This involves attributing thoughts or feelings to another person without concrete evidence, which aligns with Mind Reading. The speaker assumes the other person interpreted the statement as manipulative and blaming, which is indicative of assuming knowledge of the other's mind.",Mind Reading
909,"i love my family and friends, but i cant seem to relate to them anymore.","i love my family and friends, but i cant seem to relate to them anymore","The statement expresses a positive feeling ('I love my family and friends') followed by a negative conclusion that the speaker 'can't seem to relate to them anymore.' The use of 'anymore' implies a complete, ongoing change in the relationship. This suggests a perception of a broad, sweeping change or problem with relating to all family and friends, rather than a specific or isolated difficulty. This indicates a possible overgeneralization, where a single or some relational challenges are extended to the entire relationship group. There is no evidence of ignoring positives (mental filter), a rigid all-or-nothing statement, or emotional reasoning. The core cognitive distortion is taking a difficulty and applying it broadly to 'anymore' relationships.",Overgeneralization

This indicates a tendency to view the situation in black-or-white terms — either being fully capable or completely incapable. There is no indication of predicting the future (fortune-telling), interpreting others' thoughts (mind reading), assigning negative labels, or filtering information selectively. It also does not involve emotional reasoning or 'should' statements explicitly. Therefore, the best fitting cognitive distortion type is All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

It does not show an absolute or black-and-white perspective (ruling out All-or-Nothing Thinking), nor does it infer others' thoughts (ruling out Mind Reading), predict negative outcomes (ruling out Fortune-telling), or use labels. It also does not focus solely on negative details, magnify problems, or imply personal blame. The statement is a subjective feeling or opinion rather than a cognitive distortion.

923,This made me jealous of that person because I thought I was going to lose my fiancé.,"""I thought I was going to lose my fiancé""","The statement involves the person predicting a negative outcome (losing their fiancé) without evidence, which causes an emotional reaction (jealousy). This reflects expecting or foreseeing an undesirable event as if it is certain, fitting the concept of predicting the future negatively without proof.",Fortune-telling
924,"Starts out normal enough and the day is going fine and then bang I’m angry and not like ‘Oh I’m angry, I’ll get over it, it’s more the anger where your hands shake and your fgriends turn into your worst enemies.","‘bang I’m angry and not like ‘Oh I’m angry, I’ll get over it’, it’s more the anger where your hands shake and your friends turn into your worst enemies","The speaker describes an emotional state where the presence of anger causes a physical reaction and a drastic change in perception towards others, seeing friends as worst enemies. This reflects the cognitive distortion of Emotional Reasoning, where feelings (anger) are taken as evidence of reality (friends are enemies), rather than acknowledging that emotions may be intense but not necessarily accurate representations of truth.",Emotional Reasoning
925,"I was forced to wear dresses even before that, and I have since been afraid of men.","I was forced to wear dresses even before that, and I have since been afraid of men.","The statement links a specific past experience ('being forced to wear dresses') to a current generalized emotional response ('afraid of men'). The phrase 'I have since been afraid of men' suggests a broad and enduring fear towards all men based on previous experiences. This represents a cognitive distortion where a single or limited event is extrapolated to a wide range of situations or objects, fitting the definition of Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
926,god i am so stressed to the point of suicide.,so stressed to the point of suicide,"The statement expresses an intense emotional state ('so stressed') and directly links it to an extreme consequence ('to the point of suicide'), implying that because the speaker feels stressed, the situation is unbearable or catastrophic. This reflects an exaggeration of the stress's impact, indicating an amplification of negative feelings and outcomes beyond what might be objectively justified. This fits the pattern of 'Magnification,' where the individual blows problems out of proportion.",Magnification
927,"I cannot communicate with her in almost every aspect in my life, because we cannot understand each other.","""I cannot communicate with her in almost every aspect in my life""; ""we cannot understand each other""","The statement generalizes the communication issue to 'almost every aspect in my life' and assumes a global failure to understand each other. This reflects an overgeneralized conclusion drawn from interpersonal difficulties, without specifying isolated incidents or acknowledging possible exceptions. It is not all-or-nothing thinking since the phrase 'almost every aspect' allows some nuance, but the implication is a broad, sweeping statement about communication failure overall. The distortion best matching this is Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

Phrases like 'things suck', 'hate everything', 'hate myself more', and 'I’m too dumb' indicate harsh global evaluations of self and environment. The prediction that the future will worsen and that the person will never find love or friends represents a negative forecast without evidence. The expression 'waste of time' and 'stupid state' reflects harsh labeling of self and circumstances. However, the most dominant cognitive distortion is the negative prediction about the future outcomes ('the future will worsen', 'never find love or a decent friend'), which is classic 'Fortune-telling'. This distortion involves predicting negative outcomes as though they are certain, without sufficient evidence. While there are elements of labeling and emotional reasoning, the overriding distortion guiding the tone and ultimate conclusion is Fortune-telling about the future.",Fortune-telling
929,"I know this needs to be taken care of by a professional, but I have no idea how to get them help when neither of us have the resources to do so.",I have no idea how to get them help when neither of us have the resources to do so.,"The statement expresses a perceived inability to find a solution due to lack of resources, which suggests making a negative prediction about the future without evidence. This aligns with 'Fortune-telling' because the speaker assumes that help cannot be obtained, focusing on an anticipated negative outcome rather than considering possible alternatives or solutions. The statement acknowledges a need for professional help but focuses on a perceived barrier without exploring options, showing a prediction rather than factual certainty.",Fortune-telling
930,"I know the fear is irrational, I have no idea how I became afraid of it, I have been my whole life.  When I hear someone cough, I get very angry very fast and I feel an impulse to hurt them, but instead of hurting them I hurt myself (punching myself, hitting my head).","I know the fear is irrational; I have no idea how I became afraid of it; When I hear someone cough, I get very angry very fast; I feel an impulse to hurt them, but instead I hurt myself.","The statement acknowledges that the fear is irrational, which indicates some awareness of the emotional state rather than accepting it as fact (ruling out emotional reasoning as the main distortion). The rapid anger and impulse to harm when hearing coughing is intense emotional reactivity, but there is no indication of overgeneralizing from one event to all events, so Overgeneralization is unlikely. The person does not mention predicting negative outcomes (excluding Fortune-telling) or labeling themselves or others. The key distortion seems to be an automatic and disproportionate emotional response (anger, impulse to hurt), which can be related to Magnification—blowing the significance of the cough and the fear out of proportion, intensifying the emotional response. It is not Mind Reading or Personalization since the anger is about the cough itself and not assumptions of others’ thoughts or personal blame. There are no Should statements present. Therefore, the best fit is Magnification, as the individual is intensifying and exaggerating their fear and the associated emotional impulses related to the coughing.",Magnification

The phrase 'which has been hell to deal with and try and change' expresses a strong negative emotional evaluation of the experience. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the individual's feelings ('hell to deal with') are used as evidence that the situation is intolerable or overwhelmingly negative. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling beyond the diagnosis, or other distortions like mind reading or personalization. The statement centers on how the individual feels about their situation, hence Emotional Reasoning best fits.",Emotional Reasoning

The speaker implies that because they feel they currently lack the power or motivation, they have completely ceased seeking medical help and are about to stop trying altogether. This reflects a black-and-white thinking pattern, where the situation is seen in extremes—either fully pursuing medical help or giving up entirely—without recognizing any middle ground or alternative options.

The statement also acknowledges a reason for the behavior, ""I was so scared,"" which does not negate the presence of labeling but shows some emotional context. The central distortion here is the self-critical negative label applied based on one action or decision.",Labeling
934,i feel unwanted by people and like i always give more than other people and feel under-appreciated.,i feel unwanted by people; i always give more than other people; feel under-appreciated,"The statement contains a subjective feeling ('i feel unwanted') that is taken as evidence of reality, which aligns with emotional reasoning. The speaker assumes their feelings reflect an objective truth without external validation. Specifically, 'i feel unwanted by people' and 'feel under-appreciated' show that their emotional state is being interpreted as a factual assessment of others' behavior or thoughts.",Emotional Reasoning

However, despite these facts, they still feel unsafe and experience intense fear and paranoia. This indicates relying on their emotional experience (fear, paranoia) to interpret reality rather than evidence. The thought process is driven by feelings of fear rather than facts, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
936,And now i never think that my fearest day will come when everyone find out what’s the true.,my fearest day will come when everyone find out what’s the true,"The statement expresses a prediction about a negative future event (the worst day occurring when everyone finds out the truth). This involves anticipating a negative outcome without evidence, which is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling'. The person assumes something bad will happen in the future and acts as if it is certain.",Fortune-telling

This is an example of mind reading, where the speaker believes they know what others are thinking without concrete evidence. The distortion lies in assuming an accurate perception of others' thoughts.",Mind Reading
938,I was quite insecure.,"""I was quite insecure""","The statement reflects an emotional state ('insecure') as a fact without evidence, suggesting the person is interpreting their reality based primarily on their feelings rather than objective facts.

They presume knowledge of the other person's capacity based on their feelings rather than facts. This represents interpreting someone else's thoughts or feelings without confirmation, which fits the definition of Mind Reading.",Mind Reading
940,This has also affected my ability to trust people in my life now.,affected my ability to trust people in my life now,"The statement implies that a past event or circumstance has generalized to a broad, ongoing inability to trust people. This suggests the speaker is taking one negative experience and applying it universally to all people in their life, which fits the pattern of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
941,"Maybe because of her, I’ve always being skeptical about marriage, thinking if all men will cheat–there will be no point of being married.","skeptical about marriage, thinking if all men will cheat, there will be no point of being married","The statement generalizes the behavior of one person ('her') to all men, assuming that all men will cheat. This is a broad, sweeping conclusion based on limited evidence, reflecting an exaggerated generalization beyond the specific case. The key distortion is making a universal statement ('all men will cheat') based on one experience, which fits the definition of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

I seek unnecessary validation from people I shouldn’t, and then feel guilty about receiving validation.","hold myself to absurd expectations, know rationally that I shouldn’t, seek unnecessary validation, feel guilty about receiving validation","The key phrase 'hold myself to absurd expectations' indicates the presence of expectations or rules that the person believes they must follow, often expressed using 'should' or 'must' statements. Even though they recognize these expectations as irrational ('know rationally that I shouldn’t'), they still adhere to them, which reflects the typical cognitive distortion of imposing rigid rules on oneself. Seeking unnecessary validation and then feeling guilty suggests emotional consequences tied to these self-imposed rules but is secondary to the primary distortion. The core distortion here is the presence of rigid, irrational demands or standards the individual places on themselves, which aligns most closely with 'Should statements'.",Should statements
943,You feel strange and different from everybody else (because you ‘are’ different).,"""You feel strange and different from everybody else""; ""because you ‘are’ different""","The statement first presents a feeling (feeling strange and different), then immediately justifies it by asserting it as a fact ('because you are different'). This relies on one's emotional state to conclude a factual truth, which is a hallmark of Emotional Reasoning. The person assumes that because they feel strange, they must objectively be strange or different, without external evidence. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, fortune-telling, or other distortions here. The focus is on deriving reality from feelings.",Emotional Reasoning

This reflects an assumption about others' thoughts and feelings without evidence, effectively 'reading their minds.' The focus is on what others are thinking or feeling, which is characteristic of mind reading distortion.",Mind Reading
945,His lack of communication has made it impossible to get him professional help.,His lack of communication has made it impossible to get him professional help.,"The statement assumes that because of 'his lack of communication,' getting professional help is completely impossible. This reflects a belief that one factor entirely prevents a positive outcome, which implies an absolutist view without considering possible alternatives or nuances. This is characteristic of 'All-or-Nothing Thinking,' where the situation is seen in black-and-white terms rather than on a spectrum.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The speaker implies that because they are doing many wellness activities that dominate their life, their overall condition is worsening. This suggests a broad and generalized negative judgment about their entire situation ('getting worse') from limited evidence (just their current experience), which is characteristic of Overgeneralization. It is not All-or-Nothing since the statement does not express an absolute success/failure dichotomy but a broad negative conclusion. It is not Emotional Reasoning because it doesn't rely solely on emotions as evidence. There is no evidence of Fortune-telling, Labeling, Magnification, Mental filter, Mind Reading, Personalization, or Should statements. Therefore, the best fit is Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
947,I think he is anxious about working as he has been retired for 7 1/2 years.,"He is anxious about working, he has been retired for 7 1/2 years.",The statement assumes that the person must be anxious about working solely because he has been retired for 7 1/2 years. This is a prediction or assumption about someone's internal emotional state without direct evidence. It involves guessing someone's feelings or thoughts.,Mind Reading
948,TO realize I am incapable of emotion for anything or anyone.,I am incapable of emotion for anything or anyone,"The statement generalizes the speaker's emotional incapacity to all objects and people, implying a universal and absolute conclusion about oneself.

949,I am very stressed out and worried that this is a sign of a greater problem and that she will be kicked out of her apartment.,stressed out and worried that this is a sign of a greater problem; that she will be kicked out of her apartment,"The statement shows the person is feeling stressed and worried, interpreting their emotional state as evidence of a larger problem. This reflects 'Emotional Reasoning' because the emotion (stress and worry) is taken as proof that a negative outcome will occur. Additionally, the projection that 'she will be kicked out' represents predicting a negative future without evidence, aligning with 'Fortune-telling.' However, the core distortion centers on inferring reality from feelings, which is Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
950,Talking to even one person leaves me emotionally drained and I feel like I need to go to bed.,Talking to even one person leaves me emotionally drained and I feel like I need to go to bed.,"The statement links an emotional state (feeling emotionally drained) directly to an external event (talking to one person). The person assumes that interacting with even a single individual inevitably causes emotional exhaustion. This is not about predicting the future (Fortune-telling), nor about an absolute black-and-white stance (All-or-Nothing). The focus is on how the emotion itself is interpreted as evidence of reality ('I feel like I need to go to bed' because of emotional drain), which aligns with Emotional Reasoning. The statement does not generalize to all social interactions (so not Overgeneralization), nor does it label themselves or others negatively or apply 'should' statements.",Emotional Reasoning
951,I feel like I’ll never be free of them.,I feel like I’ll never be free of them,"The statement predicts a negative future outcome with certainty ('never be free of them') without any actual evidence.

I am very rational and I know it was wrong but in the end it didn’t matter anyways.,"""Nobody loves me"", ""I feel lost and confused"", ""I am very rational and I know it was wrong but in the end it didn’t matter anyways.""","The phrase ""Nobody loves me"" is a sweeping generalization based on presumably limited evidence, reflecting an overgeneralization distortion. The person is concluding universally that nobody loves them, which is an absolute statement often linked to overgeneralization. The admission ""I know it was wrong"" shows some rational awareness, but the feeling ""it didn’t matter anyways"" reflects a defeatist attitude possibly stemming from this distortion. Other distortions like emotional reasoning are partially present but the central distortion is the broad negative conclusion about others' feelings based on personal emotion.",Overgeneralization
953,"We grew up together and had a fine relationship back then. Up until I turned into a teenager in high school, her attitude started to change.",We grew up together and had a fine relationship back then; her attitude started to change when I turned into a teenager in high school.,"The statement reflects a clear temporal shift in the other person's attitude that the speaker noticed when they became a teenager. It focuses on a specific event as a cause for the change in attitude but does not jump to broad negative conclusions about the person as a whole, nor does it assume the other person's thoughts or feelings. The speaker is simply describing an observed change over time without distorting the situation through exaggeration, labeling, or emotional reasoning. Therefore, there is no evidence of a cognitive distortion in this statement.",No Distortion
954,She is a very jealous type of woman who has not allowed him to have female friends.,"""She is a very jealous type of woman""","The statement assigns a fixed negative label to the woman based on her behavior ('very jealous type of woman'). This simplifies her identity into a single negative characteristic rather than addressing specific behaviors or situations. It does not involve predicting future events (fortune-telling), amplifying negatives (magnification), or assuming others' thoughts (mind reading). Rather, it clearly fits the cognitive distortion known as Labeling, where a person is categorized in a negative and global way.",Labeling

956,I find myself with a unique sort of thinking for a long time ( a few years now)which finds ultimate worthlessness in achievements in life and therefore experiencing significant lack of interest in life affairs.,finds ultimate worthlessness in achievements in life; experiencing significant lack of interest in life affairs,"The key phrase 'finds ultimate worthlessness in achievements in life' indicates that the individual sees all achievements as completely worthless. This suggests a black-and-white or absolute way of thinking without recognizing any positive value in accomplishments. This aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking, where things are seen in extremes (either completely valuable or completely worthless). The individual’s lack of interest in life affairs follows from this absolute negative evaluation. There is no indication of fortune-telling (predicting future), labeling (assigning negative labels to self or others), magnification (exaggerating negatives out of proportion), or personalization (blaming self incorrectly). Emotional reasoning may be present but is secondary to the primary distortion of extreme valuation. Therefore, the best fit is All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This fits the pattern of 'Fortune-telling,' where the person assumes a negative future emotional response or judgment. The speaker also reflects on past bullying and external influences without blaming others, which shows insight rather than distortion. They do state feeling 'out of options,' but this is more an emotional state than all-or-nothing thinking or other distortions. The key cognitive distortion here is the prediction of future negative judgments from the sister, aligning with 'Fortune-telling.'",Fortune-telling
958,She knows she has memory problems and is not in denial–she just wants to avoid doing anything about it.,"""She knows she has memory problems"", ""is not in denial"", ""just wants to avoid doing anything about it""","The statement acknowledges the fact that she is aware of her memory problems, which rules out distortions involving denial or misunderstanding reality like All-or-Nothing Thinking, Fortune-telling, or Mind Reading. It attributes the behavior to a desire to avoid action rather than misinterpreting facts or emotional reasoning. There is no indication of exaggeration (Magnification), labeling herself or others negatively, or making global conclusions from this fact. The phrase 'just wants to avoid doing anything about it' reflects a judgment based on a 'should' type of expectation (i.e., she should act to address the problem), implying criticism based on an unmet obligation or expectation. Thus, the best cognitive distortion to classify this statement under is 'Should statements.'",Should statements

She talks down to me in every conversation and makes nasty digs any chance she gets and doesn’t hold back in front of my parents.","The statement describes ongoing negative behavior from the sister that is generalized across the entire relationship ('always resented me', 'bullied me throughout my life', 'every conversation').

I don’t know if these instances count legally as indecency to a minor.","The speaker expresses uncertainty about whether to disclose information to their therapist, indicating inner turmoil ('it’s eating me alive'). They also express doubt about the legal classification of certain instances, reflecting uncertainty about future events or outcomes. This reflects anticipation or prediction about something negative or unknown without firm evidence, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling'—assuming negative outcomes or uncertainty about the future.",Fortune-telling

This reflects a belief about someone else's thoughts and feelings, which fits the distortion of Mind Reading—assuming knowledge of another's mindset without confirmation.

966,He left the room clearly upset because i splashed water on his face.,He left the room clearly upset because I splashed water on his face.,"The statement assumes the reason for his emotional state (upset) is directly caused by the action (splashing water on his face). This indicates a belief that the internal emotional reaction validates the interpretation of the event. There is a direct link made between feeling distressed and the cause being the speaker's action, without external evidence. This suggests the use of emotion as evidence for an objective fact or conclusion.",Emotional Reasoning

This fits the cognitive distortion where an individual predicts negative events without sufficient information or certainty.",Fortune-telling
968,I have no ability to maintain self control over anything I do.,no ability to maintain self control over anything I do,"The phrase indicates a sweeping negative judgment about oneself, claiming a complete lack of self-control in all areas. This reflects an overgeneralization, where a specific difficulty or instance is extended broadly to all situations. It is not labeling, as it doesn't assign a fixed negative identity, nor is it emotional reasoning or fortune-telling. It doesn't present an all-or-nothing viewpoint about a situation but rather about the person's abilities in general.

The phrases imply a heightened emotional response (‘panicked’, ‘trapped’, ‘suffocating’) based on the feeling of exposure. There is no indication that they are jumping to conclusions about future events (no fortune-telling), nor labeling themselves or others, or applying all-or-nothing thinking. Rather, the speaker is reasoning based on their internal emotional experience and interpreting the situation through how they feel (fearful and trapped). This aligns closely with Emotional Reasoning – assuming that because they feel a certain way (panic, suffocation), the situation must be as threatening or hopeless as their feelings suggest.",Emotional Reasoning

There is a factual description of symptoms and triggers rather than a cognitive distortion like overgeneralization or label-driven negativity. The speaker is acknowledging a real medical diagnosis and the practical impact of anxiety symptoms. There is no evidence of irrational or biased thinking such as assuming worst outcomes (fortune-telling), making absolute judgments (all-or-nothing), or assigning negative traits to self/others (labeling).

971,But I have noticed my boyfriend is ALWAYS very angry and VERY short fused with his mother.,"ALWAYS very angry, VERY short fused","The statement uses the word 'ALWAYS' to describe the boyfriend's anger and short temper, indicating an absolute and all-encompassing judgment without exceptions. This kind of thinking categorizes behavior in black-and-white terms, which is characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking. There is an exaggeration to an extreme and no room for variability or nuance in the emotion described.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This involves assuming knowledge of others' thoughts or feelings, which corresponds to 'Mind Reading.' Additionally, the phrase 'undoubtedly ensue' reinforces the certainty about future events, but the primary distortion is the assumption about others' thoughts.",Mind Reading

We had an the worst argument I ever had with anyone!,"""I have had a lot of bad relationships"", ""I thought god finally answered my prayers"", ""I WAS WRONG"", ""We had the worst argument I ever had with anyone!""","The speaker begins by referencing numerous past negative experiences ('a lot of bad relationships'), which indicates a pattern. They express a strong expectation that a positive change would happen ('god finally answered my prayers'), but this expectation is quickly and completely negated by one negative event ('I WAS WRONG', 'the worst argument I ever had'). This reflects a pattern of thinking in extremes, where the situation is seen in black-and-white terms: either perfect or a total failure without any middle ground. This mirrors the 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' distortion. Although there is some magnification ('the worst argument'), the key overarching distortion is the all-or-nothing interpretation of the situation.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

They conclude that only they suffer if they do not engage in the activity. This centers on interpreting their internal emotional state and letting that dictate their view of reality and consequences. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where one believes something is true because they feel it strongly, regardless of objective evidence.",Emotional Reasoning
975,I believe I’m a disappointment for these interests.,I believe I’m a disappointment,"The statement reflects a negative self-assessment based on a belief, implying a global negative label about oneself (being a disappointment). This is a typical example of labeling, where the person assigns a fixed, broad negative identity to themselves rather than evaluating specific behaviors or situations. The phrase does not imply predicting the future (fortune-telling), reading others' minds, or reasoning based purely on emotions. It is not an all-or-nothing conclusion about all aspects but a specific negative label.",Labeling
976,I rarely ever go out and I’ve never had any friends in school.,"""I rarely ever go out"" and ""I’ve never had any friends in school.""","The statement generalizes a current or past experience into a universal truth about the person's social life. Saying ""I’ve never had any friends in school"" is an extreme generalization based on all experiences within that context, implying a permanent social failure.

977,"But, since we have been married, I have noticed that he gets his mind on a certain hobby and, well, almost obsesses about it.","he gets his mind on a certain hobby and, well, almost obsesses about it","The phrase suggests that since they have been married, the person has noticed a consistent pattern of behavior where the husband intensely focuses on a hobby to an extent described as 'almost obsesses.' This indicates a characterization of his behavior. The term 'almost obsesses' reflects an exaggerated description of the behavior, which aligns with an exaggeration or blowing things out of proportion. Among the cognitive distortions listed, 'Magnification' fits because it involves exaggerating the importance or intensity of events or behaviors.",Magnification
978,"She doesn’t know how I feel, at all, but I’m sure she can somewhat sense that I’m not doing okay.","She doesn’t know how I feel, at all, but I’m sure she can somewhat sense that I’m not doing okay.","The statement assumes the other person can 'somewhat sense' the speaker's emotional state without direct communication or evidence. This reflects the cognitive distortion where one believes they can know what others are thinking or feeling without explicit information. The key element is the assumption about others' thoughts or feelings, which aligns with the definition of 'Mind Reading'. It is not Fortune-telling because it is not predicting the future, nor Emotional Reasoning because it is not basing reality solely on emotion. The speaker is interpreting the other person's perceived awareness without confirmation.",Mind Reading

I am so weak and broken, traumatized and beaten up.","""I have no one else to turn to"", ""I am so weak and broken"", ""traumatized and beaten up""","The statement reflects a negative self-evaluation and a belief that there is absolutely no one available for help, indicating a broad and absolute conclusion about the situation. The phrases convey a sense of helplessness and self-criticism that goes beyond one instance, suggesting a pattern or blanket judgment rather than a nuanced view. This fits the definition of Overgeneralization, where a single or limited event is seen as a never-ending pattern of defeat or inadequacy.",Overgeneralization
980,Like it doesn’t really affect me and it makes me feel that there’s something wrong with me.,"""it makes me feel that there’s something wrong with me""","The statement suggests that the speaker's feeling or emotional response ('it makes me feel') is taken as evidence of a truth about themselves ('there’s something wrong with me'). This reflects Emotional Reasoning because the person believes their emotional state directly indicates reality, rather than recognizing that feelings can be misleading or unrelated to actual facts.",Emotional Reasoning

The phrase 'this is affecting all of my relationships' suggests a broad generalization from current feelings or specific instances to all relationships. The expression 'I cry at the slightest thing' and 'constantly sad and mad' reinforce this pervasive negative experience. This reflects a pattern where one or two experiences or emotions are generalized to an overall negative conclusion about many or all situations, fitting the distortion of Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

The concern that telling mom would cause stress and yelling represents anticipating a negative outcome without certainty, but the dominant distortion is the worldview encapsulated by 'nothing is going right,' which fits overgeneralization more closely than fortune-telling. The feeling of being too tired relates to emotional reasoning but is secondary here.",Overgeneralization
984,"Whenever the conversation turns to anything but small talk, there is a chance that I could become tearful.","Whenever the conversation turns to anything but small talk, there is a chance that I could become tearful.","The statement involves predicting a future emotional reaction based on the current or past experiences. The speaker anticipates becoming tearful in situations where the conversation shifts away from small talk. This forecasting of a negative emotional outcome without certainty aligns most closely with the cognitive distortion of 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts something negative will happen in the future.",Fortune-telling

The statement reflects interpreting emotional state as factual evidence ('I’m feeling completely blank and I’ve lost trust in myself'), which aligns with Emotional Reasoning. The person is using their feelings of confusion and difficulty as objective proof that something is wrong internally, rather than testing or questioning these feelings.",Emotional Reasoning
986,It lasted all the way through high school and even now it is possible that he could start beating me.,"""It lasted all the way through high school""; ""even now it is possible that he could start beating me""","The statement takes a past negative experience (being beaten in high school) and projects it into the future with the possibility that the same event might happen again, despite no current evidence confirming this. This reflects an attempt to predict a negative outcome based on past events, aligning with the cognitive distortion called Fortune-telling. The person is assuming a future negative event will occur purely based on past experience without concrete proof.",Fortune-telling
987,I always think he’ll leave me for some pretty girl he’ll meet.,"""I always think"", ""he’ll leave me"", ""for some pretty girl he’ll meet""","The phrase ""I always think"" indicates a certainty about a future event. The statement predicts that ""he’ll leave me"" for someone else without any concrete evidence, which is a hallmark of predicting the future negatively. This is not just an isolated worry but a definite expectation. It does not generalize life situations broadly (so not Overgeneralization), nor is it about interpreting others’ thoughts directly (not Mind Reading). It is an assumption about a future event, which aligns with Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

This indicates predicting a negative future scenario based on current emotional state rather than facts. The fear about 'he' not being able to 'pull himself out' reflects a belief about an inevitable negative outcome that cannot be changed, fitting the pattern of Fortune-telling distortion.",Fortune-telling

This demonstrates the cognitive distortion of Labeling, where a person assigns a negative and absolute label to themselves or others instead of focusing on the specific behavior or situation. Although there is an element of mind reading (assuming the mother's intentions) and emotional reasoning, the standout distortion here is the application of a derogatory global label.",Labeling

This often had made it even worse and we even lost friends due to this behavior,"The statement reveals the person's behavior of sharing arguments with friends, which they recognize as problematic and causing negative consequences like worsening the situation and losing friends. They seem to be blaming themselves for the fallout and feel guilty about their actions. This focus on their own behavior and responsibility for external negative outcomes suggests they are personalizing the situation. They take disproportionate responsibility for the impact on friendships and the argument, despite other factors likely being involved.",Personalization

This indicates attributing harmful intent to another person's behavior without clear evidence, akin to 'mind reading,' where one assumes they know what others are thinking or planning. The latter part about having a good resistance to poison is a rationalization for why the poisoning hasn't been effective, but does not negate the core distortion. Therefore, the dominant distortion is the assumption about the dad's harmful intent, which fits 'Mind Reading'.",Mind Reading
992,"To be honest I don’t know what his feelings for me are really, because he never expresses himself.",he never expresses himself,"The statement assumes knowledge about the other person's feelings based on their lack of expression.

This aligns with the 'Mind Reading' distortion, where one believes they know what others are thinking or feeling without concrete evidence.",Mind Reading
993,Those fantasies are so lucrative and pleasant its painful to wake up from them and realize that I am just a boring male.,Those fantasies are so lucrative and pleasant its painful to wake up from them and realize that I am just a boring male.,"The statement contrasts an idealized fantasy state with a negative self-assessment upon waking. The speaker labels themselves as 'just a boring male' which is a global, negative self-judgment based on the disappointment of reality compared to fantasies. This negative self-labeling fits best under 'Labeling' since the speaker is assigning a fixed negative label to themselves.",Labeling
994,But that would have been awkward and upset the rest of the family members.,"""would have been awkward"" and ""upset the rest of the family members""",The statement predicts a negative outcome (awkwardness and upsetting others) without evidence; the speaker assumes they know future events with certainty.

Then within a few days I’ll get really quiet and isolate myself. To point where I cut, and seriously plan and consider my suicide.","The statement describes swinging between extreme emotional states—from intense hyperactivity and productivity to severe withdrawal and self-harm. This depicts an all-or-nothing pattern where the individual experiences and describes emotions and behaviors in absolute extremes without middle ground or balance. The presence of extremes (very hyper/productive/aroused vs. really quiet/isolated/cutting/planning suicide) suggests a polarized view of their emotional experiences, which aligns with 'All-or-Nothing Thinking.' No other distortion fits as precisely because this is not about assuming feelings are facts (Emotional Reasoning), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or any other cognitive distortion listed.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The phrase 'dug a hole I can't get out of' indicates a feeling of being trapped due to this social withdrawal. This represents a negative generalization about their social situation without considering other factors or potential for change.

This suggests that the speaker is taking a single or limited set of experiences and extending them to all possible instances, which is characteristic of Overgeneralization. The statement also assumes knowledge about the other person's internal feelings without direct confirmation, hinting at Mind Reading.

There is no indication that the speaker is predicting the future (Fortune-telling), making extreme all-or-nothing conclusions, or labeling themselves or others broadly.

There is no indication of extreme black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), nor explicit emotional reasoning where feelings are taken as facts. The person is not predicting the future (Fortune-telling) or labeling themselves or others.

This statement predicts a future emotional outcome ('I'll be okay') without evidence, essentially making a negative prediction about an event (breakup) and its impact. The speaker is engaging in future-oriented thinking about a possible breakup, which aligns with 'fortune-telling' where a person assumes a negative outcome without certainty.",Fortune-telling

This reflects an overgeneralization because the speaker takes one event (losing one person) and generalizes it to a total social isolation, implying no one else is significant or present. It is not emotional reasoning because the statement is about a belief of having nobody, not just an emotion.

They predict possible future scenarios and interpret ambiguous signals as definitive rejection. This is an example of Fortune-telling, where the speaker attempts to predict outcomes and intentions without certainty, leading to distress and confusion.",Fortune-telling
1023,"I don’t know why, but I enjoy feeling in control of others more than I should.",I enjoy feeling in control of others more than I should,"The statement contains the phrase 'more than I should,' indicating the presence of a judgment based on an internal standard of how one believes they ought to behave. This reflects a 'Should statement' cognitive distortion, where the person criticizes themselves using 'should' or 'more than I should,' imposing rigid rules on their own feelings or actions.",Should statements
1024,"For pretty much my entire life, I’ve witnessed my mother acting like a lunatic.","""For pretty much my entire life"", ""I’ve witnessed my mother acting like a lunatic""","The phrase ""for pretty much my entire life"" indicates a sweeping generalization over a long period; it implies that the behavior has been consistent without exception. The description ""acting like a lunatic"" is a negative label applied broadly. This is not just a single incident but a generalized view over time, indicating the use of an overarching negative judgment. The key distortion here is applying one negative trait continuously across a long timeframe, which aligns with overgeneralization rather than a single negative label on an event.",Overgeneralization
1025,"I feel like if i do not do my obsession then something bad will happen. Such as my house burning down, family member getting ill or something bad happening to another human/animals.","if I do not do my obsession then something bad will happen; my house burning down, family member getting ill, or something bad happening to another human/animals","The statement reflects a belief that failing to perform a certain action (an obsession) will directly cause negative outcomes. This is a prediction about future events based on current feelings or behavior, without evidence that these events will actually happen. This fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling,' which involves arbitrarily predicting negative outcomes about the future.",Fortune-telling
1026,"How do I stop myself from losing control, all of sudden I will be freaking out screaming at the top of my lungs at my bo?","stop myself from losing control, all of sudden I will be freaking out screaming at the top of my lungs","The statement expresses an anticipation of an extreme emotional reaction occurring suddenly and uncontrollably. The phrase 'all of sudden I will be freaking out screaming' predicts a definite future event without evidence, suggesting the person is assuming that this negative outcome is certain to happen. This aligns with Fortune-telling, which involves predicting that something bad will happen in the future.",Fortune-telling

They also express a sense of urgency that if nothing is done now, it will be 'too late,' which suggests a kind of magnification of negative consequences. However, the dominant cognitive distortion here is the labeling of the behavior and implicitly the self or others as 'not normal' or lacking function, rather than a balanced assessment. The phrase 'any normal, functioning person' indicates a rigid and global characterization of people and behavior, fitting the Labeling distortion best.",Labeling
1028,I am not sure what type of disorder I am suffering from but this problem is almost killing me I am very very very very depressed and want to commit suicide because I feel it is worthless to live this type of life.  I have changed school and in my class no one seemed to like me.,"""this problem is almost killing me"", ""I am very very very very depressed and want to commit suicide"", ""it is worthless to live this type of life"", ""no one seemed to like me""","The individual expresses that the problem is 'almost killing me,' which is an extreme and absolute negative statement indicating extreme distress (possible magnification). The phrase 'I am very very very very depressed and want to commit suicide' reflects intense emotional distress but is more descriptive of their emotional state rather than a distortion. The statement 'it is worthless to live this type of life' generalizes the entire life as worthless based on current suffering, reflecting overgeneralization and all-encompassing negative judgment. 'In my class no one seemed to like me' assumes a negative social reality that might not be based on direct evidence, indicating possible mind reading where the person assumes others' thoughts and feelings. Among these, the primary distortion is overgeneralization—taking a specific negative event or feeling and generalizing it to a global negative conclusion about their life and social standing.",Overgeneralization

I cannot hold down a job.,"""I feel I am useless to my kids or my husband"", ""because of the psychological problems I cannot be normal"", ""I cannot hold down a job.""","The speaker is concluding they are 'useless' based on their psychological problems and difficulties with employment. The phrase 'I feel I am useless' reflects an intense negative self-label rather than a balanced view. This aligns most closely with Labeling, which involves assigning a global negative label to oneself based on specific perceived failures or traits. There is no indication of absolute terms (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or filtering evidence. Emotional reasoning might be involved since it starts with 'I feel', but the key distortion is the negative global self-labeling. Thus, the primary distortion is Labeling.",Labeling
1030,What’s wrong with me?,"""What’s wrong with me?""","The statement expresses a self-critical view implying that there is something inherently flawed about the speaker as a person. This reflects an internal, negative global evaluation or judgment about the self, which aligns with the cognitive distortion called Labeling. It is not all-or-nothing thinking, which involves black-or-white extremes, nor fortune-telling, which is predicting future outcomes. Emotional reasoning is about assuming feelings reflect facts, which is close but this is more about assigning a negative label to oneself. Therefore, this is best classified as Labeling.",Labeling
1031,Anyways i think ive just got a messed up sense of humor and i just wanted to ask what you people thought.,i think ive just got a messed up sense of humor,"The speaker is attributing a negative personal label to themselves based on their perception of their sense of humor. This involves assigning a global negative trait to their character ('messed up sense of humor'), which fits the pattern of labeling, where a broad, negative label is applied to oneself.",Labeling
1032,I haven’t told anyone this I know they’ll say “stop acting crazy” Or that’s ridiculous.,I know they’ll say 'stop acting crazy' or 'that’s ridiculous',"The statement involves the speaker assuming they know what others will say about them without any direct evidence. This reflects an act of 'mind reading'—believing they can predict other people's thoughts or reactions negatively, leading to hesitation to share. This is not fortune-telling (predicting future events), labeling (assigning global negative terms about self or others), or emotional reasoning (basing conclusions purely on feelings). Instead, it is the cognitive distortion where one presumes knowledge of others' thoughts.",Mind Reading

This is a prediction without concrete evidence, based purely on fear and assumption. The person is forecasting a negative outcome (a fight) without certainty, which aligns with predicting a future event negatively.",Fortune-telling
1034,"I just want to know what is wrong with me, and if there is anything I can do to stop it.","""what is wrong with me"", ""if there is anything I can do to stop it""","The statement reflects a self-critical perspective worrying that there is something inherently 'wrong' with the speaker. This indicates a negative labeling of the self. The speaker is also seeking solutions to 'stop it,' implying a sense of defectiveness or failure. Among the distortions, 'Labeling' fits best because it involves assigning a negative global label to oneself based on perceived issues.",Labeling
1035,I’m pretty sure not interacting at the critical point of social development has had lasting affects.,not interacting at the critical point of social development has had lasting affects,"The statement assumes that because there was no interaction during a critical social development phase, it definitely caused lasting effects.

It fits the characteristic of 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts a negative outcome as certain.",Fortune-telling
1036,I know I should seek proper counseling and not ask questions online but I’m curious to hear your opinions on the matter.,I know I should seek proper counseling and not ask questions online,"The statement includes the phrase 'I should seek proper counseling and not ask questions online,' which reflects a rigid rule or belief about what one 'should' do. This aligns with the cognitive distortion known as 'Should statements,' where a person imposes strict expectations on themselves or others. There is no evidence in the sentence of other distortions such as all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or mind reading. The speaker shows awareness and curiosity, indicating no distortion about certainty or fortune-telling either. Therefore, the embedded cognitive distortion is the use of 'should' statements.",Should statements
1037,"There’s only two people I would never be able to kill, and they’re not a part of my family, which means I have to control myself greatly each day around the people I’m supposed to ‘love’.","‘There’s only two people I would never be able to kill’, ‘they’re not a part of my family’, ‘I have to control myself greatly each day around the people I’m supposed to ‘love’’",The statement suggests an absolute condition about the speaker's capability to kill only two people and implies a strict limitation based on family membership. The phrase 'only two people I would never be able to kill' shows an all-or-nothing mindset—either they can kill everyone else or these two. This black-and-white thinking highlights the rigidity in their view. The additional point about needing to exercise great control around people they ‘love’ due to this rigid boundary supports the presence of an extreme category-based thought rather than nuanced or balanced reasoning.,All-or-Nothing Thinking
1038,Can’t enjoy anything I love.,Can’t enjoy anything I love,The statement suggests a sweeping negative conclusion that the person is unable to enjoy any activity they love. This implies a broad generalization based on presumably limited or specific negative experiences.

The speaker assumed the other person would behave gently, but they didn't. This is a prediction about how someone will act without sufficient evidence, reflecting a belief about the future outcome that is not guaranteed. It is not a global negative judgment (All-or-Nothing), not interpreting emotions as facts (Emotional Reasoning), not attributing others' thoughts (Mind Reading), not exaggerating or magnifying events, not filtering, nor labeling, nor overly personalizing or using 'should' statements explicitly. Thus, the most appropriate category is Fortune-telling, which involves predicting a negative or specific outcome without certainty.",Fortune-telling
1041,I have a mental illness for sure.,I have a mental illness for sure,"The statement assigns a definitive and global label to the self ('I have a mental illness for sure') without considering nuances or the complexity of mental health. It directly labels the self with a negative identity based on a single attribute or feeling, which fits the definition of 'Labeling' as a cognitive distortion. It is not about interpreting feelings or predicting future events, nor is it an all-or-nothing black-and-white thinking or exaggeration. The key aspect is the use of a negative, definitive label applied to oneself.",Labeling

The phrase ""God knows how they will react"" shows that the speaker is predicting others' negative reactions without evidence. This fits the pattern of predicting future outcomes negatively (fortune-telling). Although ""No one understands me"" might hint at overgeneralization, the stronger distortion involves predicting an unknown future reaction, which is characteristic of fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
1043,"I had panick attacks and couldn’t study at all in my last year in high school.

I’m never happy about any of my achievements and I think nothing is important in my life.",“I’m never happy about any of my achievements” and “I think nothing is important in my life.”,"The person expresses a persistent negative evaluation of their achievements, indicating an extreme negative viewpoint without middle ground. The statement “I’m never happy” suggests an absolute, all-encompassing judgment about their feelings towards achievements. Similarly, saying “nothing is important in my life” reflects a sweeping conclusion that disregards any positive or neutral aspects. These patterns fit the definition of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where situations and self-assessments are viewed in black-or-white terms rather than a balanced perspective.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The main cognitive distortion here is the assumption about what the partner feels and thinks, which aligns with 'Mind Reading'. The first thought about routine is more of a hopeful expectation rather than a distortion, and the phrase 'should just let him go' reflects contemplation, not a 'Should statement' in the distorted sense.",Mind Reading
1045,"During this time, a lot of traumatic memories have come alive and started to overtake my mind.","""a lot of traumatic memories have come alive"" and ""started to overtake my mind""","The phrase ""started to overtake my mind"" indicates the individual is interpreting their current emotional state as evidence that their mind is being overwhelmed or controlled by traumatic memories. This reflects emotional reasoning, where feelings (being overtaken by memories) are taken as factual evidence about the extent and impact of those memories. There is no indication of exaggeration beyond emotions, nor predictions or labeling, but a direct link between feelings and perceived reality.",Emotional Reasoning

The speaker is concluding that the other person is always ready to be upset and is predicting future emotional reactions, leading to hyper-vigilance and cautious behavior. This aligns with the distortion of predicting negative outcomes about someone's feelings or reactions without sufficient data.",Fortune-telling
1047,Nobody really knows me for who I am.,"""Nobody really knows me for who I am.""","The statement makes a broad claim about what 'nobody' knows about the speaker, implying a universal negative assumption without specific evidence.

The phrase 'I know that’s horrible' indicates that the speaker is judging their own feeling as bad based on an emotional reaction rather than objective evidence. Additionally, 'I can’t help it' suggests resignation to this feeling. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the person believes that their negative emotion (wanting to be sick and feeling horrible about it) is evidence of truth about the situation or themselves.",Emotional Reasoning

This reflects an expectation of a specific, usually unpleasant, future without solid evidence. The person is essentially making a negative prediction about their mental health based on the current scary thoughts and sensations, which aligns with the 'Fortune-telling' distortion. Other distortions like emotional reasoning are present (thinking that scary thoughts indicate a real illness), but the core distortion is predicting future illness, hence Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

1053,Because I am so afraid I am never going to have the opportunity to experience this.,"Because I am so afraid, I am never going to have the opportunity to experience this.","The statement assumes a negative future outcome ('never going to have the opportunity') based solely on a present feeling of fear. This reflects predicting a negative event without concrete evidence, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling'. It is not emotional reasoning because the conclusion is about a future event rather than interpreting current reality based on emotions. It does not reflect other distortions like all-or-nothing or labeling, as no extremes or personal judgments are made.",Fortune-telling

Additionally, it assumes an outcome about others' behavior ('they would always forgive their son') based on speculative reasoning. This illustrates expecting certain negative or positive future events without sufficient proof, which aligns with the distortion of 'Fortune-telling.' The statement is not absolute or dichotomous, so it is not All-or-Nothing Thinking. It does not generalize from one incident to all, so it's not Overgeneralization. It does not involve assigning labels, emotional reasoning, or mind reading directly. Hence, Fortune-telling is the best fit.",Fortune-telling

This is a prediction about the future outcome based on current difficulties. The person is assuming that any further attempts will be futile without evidence that every attempt will definitely fail. This aligns with the distortion of 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts a negative outcome without sufficient proof. Other distortions such as Overgeneralization or Emotional Reasoning are less precise because the emphasis is on predicting future failure (fortune-telling) rather than solely emotional experience or overgeneralizing one event to all situations.",Fortune-telling
1057,I’ve been losing emotions to everything.,I’ve been losing emotions to everything,"The phrase 'losing emotions to everything' suggests a broad, sweeping statement about the person's emotional state affecting all areas or all experiences. The use of 'everything' indicates a generalization beyond specific events or contexts to all situations. This points to a pattern of taking one or a few instances and extending them universally, which aligns with the definition of Overgeneralization. There is no evidence of thinking in extremes (All-or-Nothing), interpreting things based solely on feelings (Emotional Reasoning), predicting negative outcomes (Fortune-telling), or assigning labels. Thus, the most fitting distortion is Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

The use of terms like ""always"" and ""ever since I could walk"" extends the negative experience across the entire timeline without exceptions. This reflects a pattern of drawing broad conclusions from specific or repeated events, typical of overgeneralization. There is no indication of extremes (all-or-nothing), nor evidence that the speaker is interpreting emotions alone (emotional reasoning), nor predicting the future (fortune-telling), nor labeling a single characteristic, nor focusing on magnifying just one aspect, nor filtering details selectively, nor assuming others’ thoughts (mind reading), nor applying personalization or should statements.",Overgeneralization

This indicates a broad generalization from multiple instances (disappointment, embarrassment, feeling un-special) to a consistent personal response (giving up). The person extends this reaction to various life domains (jobs, relationships, committees), which suggests the mindset has been generalized over time rather than confined to a single event or context.",Overgeneralization

She always wants pity.","The statement attributes a consistent negative trait to 'her' that affects everyone ('She drives all of us crazy'), which suggests a broad generalization about her behavior. The phrase 'She always wants pity' further supports a tendency to view her actions in an overly negative and consistent way, indicating an overgeneralization. Additionally, the concern about the brother not talking enough leading to her being mad reflects interpreting others' thoughts and feelings without evidence, which is mind reading. However, since the overall focus is on the consistent negative view applied to her behavior across situations, the dominant distortion is 'Overgeneralization'.",Overgeneralization

This suggests the individual is overgeneralizing their experience of obsessive thoughts as an ongoing, daily problem across many domains. There is no evidence of labeling oneself or others, nor assuming what others think (mind reading), predicting the future (fortune-telling), or exclusively focusing on negative details (mental filter). Emotional reasoning is not directly present since the person states a fact rather than drawing conclusions from feelings. Likewise, should statements or all-or-nothing extremes are not evident. Therefore, the closest cognitive distortion is overgeneralization due to the broad, repetitive nature implied.",Overgeneralization

The phrase 'the voices that say I will fail and I amount to nothing' points to assigning a global negative label to oneself. The ongoing decline of self-esteem across time ('with every year') indicates a pervasive, stable negative self-judgment rather than a situational issue, aligning with labeling.

They also believe their parents are tired of them discussing trauma and that they are a bother, which involves assuming others' feelings without direct proof (mind reading).

The fear of what mental health professionals and parents might do suggests an expectation of harmful outcomes based on fear, rather than evidence, which could suggest fortune-telling.

They express intense resentment and conclude that returning to old behaviors (picking back up) is their only option. This reflects reasoning based on their emotional state and circumstances rather than objective evidence, suggesting they feel overwhelmed and see no other possible outcome. The thought that 'picking back up is my only answer' stems from emotional distress rather than a balanced evaluation of alternatives, indicating Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

The phrase 'I used to be an excellent man once but now I am nothing' exemplifies an extreme negative judgment that categorizes the self as completely worthless. This is characteristic of Labeling, where the individual assigns an absolute negative label ('nothing') to themselves rather than focusing on specific situations or behaviors. The emotional reasoning ('I feel worthless') supports this internalized negative labeling.

The phrase 'should bother me' indicates an expectation or a belief about how one is supposed to feel. The speaker acknowledges this expectation but points out their own experience does not align with it. The key distortion here is the use of 'should' which imposes rigid rules or demands on feelings or behavior. This matches the 'Should statements' cognitive distortion where people have fixed expectations about how things 'should' be, which can lead to frustration or confusion when reality does not meet those standards.",Should statements

This reflects drawing a broad conclusion based on limited specific instances, applying a persistent negative outcome to a generalized sense of self. The reference to it 'happening since I was a young child' indicates a pattern assumed to be continuous and unchanging.

This fear is based on an assumption about the future or a medical diagnosis without clear evidence, reflecting a prediction of a negative outcome. The person is essentially 'fortune-telling' — predicting a negative situation (being schizophrenic and untreated) without certainty. The statement does not exhibit all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, labeling, or emotional reasoning explicitly. Instead, it focuses on a feared future scenario.",Fortune-telling

This reflects the speaker attributing specific negative intentions or attitudes to their parents without explicit evidence and based on their perception. The use of 'what I consider' indicates awareness of subjectivity, but the speaker is effectively assuming to know their parents' stance or feelings, which aligns with the cognitive distortion of Mind Reading (assuming to know what others think or feel without direct confirmation).

The individual feels like a 'disappointment' to their family based on their perceived failures, which suggests they are taking these events as a reflection of their own worth. This involves attributing external outcomes (failure, family disappointment) directly to their personal value, a hallmark of Personalization. They are also emotionally interpreting these events (hating self more), but the main distortion is interpreting failure as a personal defect rather than situational or changeable.

The person also expresses a lack of motivation and an inability to differentiate between what is real and what is not, leading to a generally negative appraisal of themselves and their situation. The pervasive negative self-labeling (e.g., 'irrational and crazy,' 'I hate talking about how I feel'), and the feeling of being overwhelmed by emotions and unable to act effectively, indicate a pattern of negatively labeling oneself rather than objectively evaluating specific events or behaviors. The content does not specifically reflect absolute extremes (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), assuming others’ thoughts (Mind Reading), or other distortions as clearly as labeling does here.

The phrase 'I suspect that I have borderline personality disorder' suggests the speaker is making a judgment or labeling themselves based on past events and feelings. This links closely to the cognitive distortion of 'Labeling,' where an individual assigns a global negative label to themselves based on specific incidents or traits. The statement is not simply about predicting the future (fortune-telling), nor is it a matter of 'should statements.'

The key issue is the speaker extrapolating from a few current difficulties or facts to a global negative conclusion about their entire life’s value or meaning. This is characteristic of overgeneralization, where one or few negative events or facts are generalized to an overall negative view. The statement does not represent all-or-nothing thinking (which is about extremes and absolute terms), emotional reasoning (which would be concluding truth based on feelings alone without facts), fortune-telling (predicting the future negatively), labeling (assigning a global negative label to oneself), or other distortions listed.",Overgeneralization

This is a broad generalization based on a single or few experiences, suggesting that every morning she behaves this way.

The embarrassment stems from this comparison. The key cognitive distortion here is 'Should statements' because the individual implicitly believes they 'should' have kissed someone by now, based on the perceived norm.

This shows the speaker is attributing their personal experience to external causes involving others, which involves making assumptions about the cause without direct evidence. However, the tones of the statement indicate the speaker is speculating ('I wonder if'), which aligns with guessing the future or unknown causes. Since the speaker is hypothesizing about the cause without certainty, this involves a degree of 'Fortune-telling'—predicting or guessing about why things happened without firm evidence. It is not labeling (assigning a fixed negative label to oneself or others), nor personalization (taking excessive responsibility).",Fortune-telling

I will stew about it until I become worried that they are going to kill me and leave my body somewhere.,"The statement shows a progression from a negative feeling (husband’s family does not like me) to a highly exaggerated and catastrophic outcome (they are going to kill me and leave my body somewhere). This reflects an irrational escalation of the potential consequences, which matches the definition of catastrophizing. Among the options, 'Magnification' corresponds to exaggerating the importance or seriousness of events. 'Fortune-telling' would be predicting negative outcomes without evidence but does not necessarily involve extreme exaggeration. The core distortion here is the extreme exaggeration of negative outcomes, which is best captured by 'Magnification.'",Magnification

The second phrase expresses a negative prediction about the future ('nothing’s going to work out'), which aligns with fortune-telling, predicting negative outcomes without evidence. However, since the speaker's emotional state is tied to a belief that nothing is actually wrong despite feeling unhappy, the core distortion connects more directly to Emotional Reasoning — assuming that emotions reflect objective reality (i.e., feeling unhappy means there must be a reason, and because there is none, the feeling is 'wrong').

She interprets the situation as overwhelmingly negative and catastrophic, believing that it is destroying her and the family.

It also reflects a broad conclusion about the mother’s intentions and actions based on repeated instances, suggesting an overextension from particular events to a wide-held belief about the mother’s behavior. This points to overgeneralization, where the individual perceives many experiences as uniformly negative and overwhelming. Other distortions like Mind Reading or Labeling are less fitting because there is no explicit assumption of others' thoughts or a fixed negative label; instead, the focus is on sweeping conclusions about the mother’s behavior across time.",Overgeneralization

Additionally, the concern that the person isn’t getting help because of ongoing paranoia assumes a negative outcome about the present and future state. The key cognitive distortion at play is presuming to know the thoughts and intentions of another person ('he isn’t being totally honest'). This reflects 'Mind Reading' because the speaker is attributing thoughts or honesty levels to someone else without clear evidence.",Mind Reading

The phrase 'things have gone worse' indicates a broad negative judgment rather than a specific event-related or partial difficulty. This aligns with overgeneralization, where one sees a single negative experience as a never-ending pattern of defeat.

The use of 'almost everything' suggests a sweeping generalization rather than a balanced or specific assessment.

The speaker is attributing knowledge or feelings to others without explicit evidence ('know that it would tear them apart'), which fits the definition of mind reading and fortune-telling. However, the dominant distortion is about predicting what will happen emotionally to the parents, which is fortune-telling. Mind reading focuses on knowing others' thoughts, whereas fortune-telling is predicting future outcomes negatively without certainty.

The statement 'I can’t do anything right' reflects a global negative judgment about the self.

The speaker uses their feelings ('I feel unlovable') as evidence of reality ('this world doesn’t want me'), indicating reliance on feelings rather than objective proof, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning. The statement does not strictly involve predicting the future (Fortune-telling), nor does it involve labeling oneself or others with an absolute negative term alone, but rather uses feelings as a factual basis. The reasoning does not reflect all-or-nothing thinking with explicit extremes, nor does it filter details or personalize blame explicitly. Therefore, the core distortion is Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

This suggests the person is emotionally overwhelmed by their feelings of fear, allowing the emotion (fear/panic) to dictate their perception and behavior. The panic response is based directly on the emotional experience rather than rational evaluation of the actual threat.

The phrase 'I can never make up for lost time' and 'I can never seem to catch up' indicate a sense of permanence and totality, suggesting an extreme, either-or thinking pattern with no middle ground or possibility for success. The speaker feels either completely left behind or fails entirely, which aligns with all-or-nothing thinking.

The description of the father with strong negative labels such as ""control freak,"" ""drunkard,"" and ""little abusive"" demonstrates labeling, where the person applies harsh, global labels to their father. However, the primary emotional content focuses on a sweeping negative outcome about the speaker's own life (dreams dying) that is seen as inevitable or already happening. This indicates overgeneralization, where the difficult relationship and traumatic experiences with the father lead to a broad, generalized conclusion negatively affecting the speaker's outlook on their own life.

This suggests the individual is making a broad conclusion based on possibly many instances or a few strong memories, extending it indefinitely.

1202,This has come to a crisis point where I have had to suspend my 3rd year at university because I felt very anxious about everyone thinking I was crazy and meetings were terrifying me.,"""felt very anxious about everyone thinking I was crazy"" and ""meetings were terrifying me""","The key phrase ""felt very anxious about everyone thinking I was crazy"" implies the person assumes they know what others are thinking, specifically that everyone thinks negatively about them. This reflects the cognitive distortion of Mind Reading, where one believes they can understand others' thoughts without evidence. The other phrase about meetings being terrifying supports the emotional response but does not change the primary distortion type.",Mind Reading
1203,I m an empath and my boyfriend is a narcissist.  he doesn’t care about my feelings,"""I am an empath"", ""my boyfriend is a narcissist"", ""he doesn’t care about my feelings""","The speaker assigns a global negative label to their boyfriend by calling him a ""narcissist,"" which goes beyond describing specific behaviors and implies a fixed character flaw. This is an example of Labeling, where a person's identity is defined by a single negative trait. Additionally, the statement ""he doesn’t care about my feelings"" might reflect an interpretation but the primary distortion is in the use of the label. There is no clear evidence of other distortions like mind reading or emotional reasoning since the focus is on the fixed negative categorization.",Labeling
1204,But I cannot make him talk to me so he is never going to understand and I am doomed forever to the abandonment I feel.

The phrase 'I am doomed forever to the abandonment I feel' reflects a catastrophic and certain view of the future, reinforcing this. Additionally, the speaker assumes the other person's thoughts and feelings ('he views it something I made up to manipulate him') without direct confirmation, which suggests Mind Reading; however, the primary emphasis is on predicting an inevitable negative future. Therefore, the dominant distortion is Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
1205,And ignoring the problem feels like it could only make things worse.,"""ignoring the problem feels like it could only make things worse""","The statement expresses a belief about a future outcome (things getting worse) based on the current action of ignoring the problem. The use of ""could only make things worse"" indicates a prediction about what will happen if the problem is ignored. This fits the definition of Fortune-telling, where someone predicts negative outcomes without sufficient evidence. The other distortions do not fit as well: it is not an all-or-nothing extreme view, nor is it emotional reasoning (no direct inference based solely on feelings), labeling, or personalization. It is a negative prediction about the future, which is typical of Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
1206,"I’ve always been an anxious kid, but this increased and now it has reached to the point where sometimes I can’t eat in public much. Since I am dealing with overweight issues, i feel like anything everyone will be thinking why I’m eating even though I’m fat already.","""I can’t eat in public much"", ""I feel like anything everyone will be thinking why I’m eating even though I’m fat already""","The statement reveals the person assumes they know what others are thinking ('everyone will be thinking why I’m eating even though I’m fat already') without any evidence. This reflects 'Mind Reading' because the person is attributing specific negative thoughts to others about themselves. While there are feelings of anxiety and self-judgment, the primary distortion here is assuming insight into others' thoughts.",Mind Reading

I didn’t say anything and thought it was I was reading to much in to it.,a little girl walk by and he was undressing her with his eyes; I didn’t say anything and thought it was I was reading too much into it,"The speaker interprets the man's gaze as 'undressing her with his eyes,' which reflects an assumption about his intentions without him stating anything. Then the speaker doubts their own interpretation by thinking they might be 'reading too much into it.' This indicates an attempt to infer the thoughts or intentions of another person without direct evidence. This matches 'Mind Reading' distortion where one assumes they know what others are thinking.",Mind Reading
1208,I’m afraid if anyone who’s close to me is late (Even 2 minutes late).,I’m afraid if anyone who’s close to me is late (Even 2 minutes late).,"The statement reflects a fear based on a specific belief about lateness, assuming negative outcomes simply because someone is even slightly late. This involves predicting a negative scenario without evidence, which aligns with expecting future misfortune. It is not about labeling, magnifying, or personal blame, but about anticipating a bad event before it happens, characteristic of Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

The statement assumes the situation has been persistent for a very long time, potentially without exceptions, reflecting a pattern of overgeneralizing from current or past experiences. The statement about family not doing anything suggests a general conclusion about their behavior based on past or current observations, reinforcing the overgeneralization. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, labeling, magnification, mental filter, mind reading, personalization, or should statements in this context.",Overgeneralization
1210,"I feared that I’d be stuck with this forever, and thus my symptoms just kept getting worse as a result.","I feared that I’d be stuck with this forever, and thus my symptoms just kept getting worse as a result.","The statement involves predicting a negative future outcome ('I feared that I’d be stuck with this forever') without concrete evidence, which corresponds to making a negative forecast about the future. This matches the distortion type of 'Fortune-telling,' where one assumes or predicts that something bad will happen. Additionally, the belief that symptoms got worse as a direct result of the fear implies a cause-effect assumption linked with this negative future expectation, reinforcing the distortion. There is no indication of all-or-nothing terms, labeling, or emotional reasoning as the primary distortion.",Fortune-telling
1211,The reason I suspect I may have been sexually abused as a child is because my memory keeps bringing me back to this journal that I had.,I suspect I may have been sexually abused as a child; my memory keeps bringing me back to this journal that I had.,"The statement expresses suspicion about past abuse based on the recurring memory triggered by a journal. The person is using the presence of a memory (an emotional or mental experience) as evidence that abuse may have occurred. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings or mental experiences are used as proof of reality without objective verification. The statement does not involve labeling, fortune-telling, all-or-nothing thinking, or other distortions listed, nor does it definitively conclude abuse, only suspects it, so no extreme overgeneralization or personalization is present.",Emotional Reasoning
1212,"I have a terrible dread of my mom’s death. She is in her eighties and I feel I can’t go on without her.

This reflects predicting a negative future outcome with certainty. The guilt about not moving and the past decision to go to law school to cure depression indicate emotional reasoning tied to self-judgment and regret. The central distortion is the certainty of a negative future and the emotional response to it, which aligns most closely with 'Fortune-telling' because the speaker is predicting a distressing outcome (mom’s death and personal inability to cope) without evidence and treats it as inevitable.",Fortune-telling
1213,Most of the time I’m getting really angry at the smallest things and my behavior while in this state really worries me.,Most of the time I’m getting really angry at the smallest things and my behavior while in this state really worries me.,"The phrase 'Most of the time' indicates a broad generalization about how often the anger occurs, suggesting the individual is applying a sweeping conclusion to many situations. This is characteristic of Overgeneralization, where one interprets a single or few instances as a never-ending pattern. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or other distortions explicitly in the statement. The concern about behavior is reflective but does not indicate a distortion itself.",Overgeneralization

This suggests that the individual is making a sweeping generalization about their experiences. The accompanying statement ""I generally feel overwhelmed in life"" supports the idea of a broad, pervasive negative view. This fits the definition of Overgeneralization, where a single negative event or feeling is viewed as a never-ending pattern.",Overgeneralization
1216,"I did dated guys, we kissed, but when it comes to more I feel shy and scared to say I’m a virgin at my age.",I feel shy and scared to say I’m a virgin at my age.,"The statement reveals an emotional experience ('feel shy and scared'), which leads the speaker to a certain belief or conclusion about themselves (being a virgin at their age is something to be scared or shy about). This reflects the cognitive distortion known as 'Emotional Reasoning,' where the individual assumes that their emotional state accurately reflects reality (i.e., feeling scared means there is something wrong or shameful about being a virgin). There is no indication of other distortions such as overgeneralization or labeling; rather, the focus is on interpreting reality through the lens of emotion.",Emotional Reasoning

This indicates the speaker is assuming a negative outcome without evidence, essentially 'fortune-telling' a distressing future scenario. Although there is an emotional component (panic, fear), the core distortion here involves predicting a harmful outcome rather than reasoning based on current evidence or facts.",Fortune-telling

I tend to believe that this was due to a very hard break up that I had when I was around 21.,"""this is not the case for many years now""; ""I tend to believe that this was due to a very hard break up when I was around 21""","The speaker is attributing their current negative situation directly and exclusively to a specific past event (a hard break-up at age 21). This suggests a causal link based primarily on personal experience, reflecting a tendency to personalize their current issue as caused by that event. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or labeling; nor is the person making generalized claims beyond their own experience. Emotional reasoning could be considered but the focus is on attributing an outcome to a personal event, indicating personalization.",Personalization
1220,I’m scared I can’t control it anymore.,"I’m scared, I can’t control it anymore","The statement expresses a fear based on a feeling ('I’m scared') that the speaker has lost control ('I can’t control it anymore'). There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions. Instead, the speaker is drawing a conclusion or belief directly from their emotional state, which fits the definition of Emotional Reasoning. This type of distortion occurs when one assumes that their emotional reaction necessarily reflects reality.",Emotional Reasoning
1221,"Something in my head, not a voice but a feeling, told me she was going to dig her nails into my back and rip out my heart.",a feeling told me she was going to dig her nails into my back and rip out my heart,"The statement describes an internal feeling that predicts a negative action without concrete evidence or communicated intent. This indicates the person is assuming knowledge about another's harmful intentions based solely on an internal feeling, rather than actual facts. This aligns with 'Fortune-telling', where one predicts a negative future event without evidence.",Fortune-telling
1222,"I’m also convinced that other people can read my thoughts, maybe not everyone, but definitely most people.","other people can read my thoughts, maybe not everyone, but definitely most people","The statement assumes that other people have direct access to the speaker’s thoughts without any evidence. This reflects the cognitive distortion where one believes they know what others are thinking, often assuming negative or intrusive thoughts are apparent to others. The phrase ‘other people can read my thoughts’ directly aligns with the definition of Mind Reading. It is not about predicting the future (Fortune-telling), nor is it about focusing only on negatives or labels. The belief here is specifically about perceiving others’ thoughts, which fits Mind Reading exactly.",Mind Reading

As last week it was apparent she needed affirmation from me that the anger work was useful.,I feel again she is in decision making to terminate me; she needed affirmation from me that the anger work was useful.,"The statement involves the speaker inferring the intentions and thoughts of another person ('she is in decision making to terminate me') without concrete evidence, based on feelings and observations. This indicates an assumption about what the other person is thinking or planning, fitting the definition of 'Mind Reading'. The speaker also notes the other person's need for affirmation, interpreting their behavior as a sign of a specific decision, which further supports the 'Mind Reading' distortion rather than emotional reasoning or fortune-telling.",Mind Reading

The speaker is assuming they know what others are thinking — that those others hate them — which aligns with the cognitive distortion called Mind Reading. The speaker is interpreting others' intentions and feelings negatively without clear proof, which matches Mind Reading rather than Fortune-telling (predicting future events) or Emotional Reasoning (assuming feelings reflect facts).",Mind Reading

The speaker assumes control over others' perceptions without explicit evidence and believes that others will be helpful in the future based on these perceptions. This involves assuming what others are thinking without confirmation, which aligns with 'Mind Reading'. The focus is not an extreme black-or-white view, nor is it generalized or labeled in a categorical way. It does not predict the future (fortune-telling), nor magnify or filter specific details, nor involves should statements or personalization in the classical sense.",Mind Reading
1226,"By all accounts, I should be highly successful.","""By all accounts"", ""I should be highly successful""","The phrase ""By all accounts"" suggests reliance on external opinions or evidence suggesting a specific conclusion. The statement ""I should be highly successful"" indicates an internal expectation or obligation that success is the expected outcome. This fits the 'Should statements' distortion because it involves an internalized demand or rule about how things ought to be, which can create pressure or disappointment if unmet. It is not fortune-telling (predicting a future), nor emotional reasoning, nor any other distortion listed here.",Should statements
1227,"It’s like an obsession, and I think that’s it’s because I’ve always had a hard time classifying my emotions, so I try to classify my thoughts instead.","obsession, hard time classifying my emotions, try to classify my thoughts instead","The statement describes a difficulty in handling emotions, leading to an alternative strategy of categorizing thoughts. The speaker attributes their obsessive thinking to an inability to properly label emotions. This involves assigning global labels ('obsession') to their experience and using labeling to classify thoughts instead of emotions. The key cognitive distortion present here is 'Labeling' because the individual is focusing on assigning fixed, global tags (like 'obsession') to their mental processes rather than seeing them as fluid or complex. There is no evidence of other distortions such as all-or-nothing, fortune-telling, or emotional reasoning in this context.",Labeling
1228,The anxiety I get from it has changed me completely and I can’t do anything I used to.,The anxiety I get from it has changed me completely and I can’t do anything I used to.,"The statement generalizes the impact of anxiety to a complete and permanent change affecting all previous capabilities. It suggests that due to anxiety, the person believes they are entirely incapable of doing anything they used to do, which is an overextension from the experience of anxiety to a universal and absolute conclusion about their abilities.",Overgeneralization

This indicates the speaker is blaming themselves for someone else's behavior, which aligns with the cognitive distortion of Personalization, where a person takes responsibility or blame for something that is not entirely within their control.",Personalization
1230,"They want me to give myself time to think about my relationship, where really I know they just want me to end the relationship.","""They want me to give myself time to think about my relationship"", ""I know they just want me to end the relationship""","The speaker interprets another person's intention without explicit evidence, assuming they want the relationship to end.

1231,I felt guilty because I felt happiness when somebody died in a movie I was watching.,I felt guilty because I felt happiness when somebody died in a movie I was watching.,"The statement indicates that the person is judging their feelings (happiness) based on an emotional reaction to an external event (someone's death in a movie). The feeling of guilt arises not from objective facts but from the person's emotional experience itself. This suggests that the individual is using their emotions as evidence to draw conclusions about what is right or wrong, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning. There is no suggestion of exaggeration, prediction, or labeling; rather, it's a direct inference from an emotional state.",Emotional Reasoning
1232,"I find it difficult to articulate my thoughts alone, but to explain it to her seems almost impossible.",difficult to articulate my thoughts alone; explaining it to her seems almost impossible,"The statement first acknowledges difficulty in expressing thoughts alone, which is a subjective experience, but then escalates to a judgment that explaining it to 'her' is 'almost impossible.' This suggests an expectancy about a future interaction that may not be based on evidence but rather on anticipated failure. The phrase 'seems almost impossible' is a prediction about a future event without certain proof, indicating a negative expectation. This fits the definition of Fortune-telling, where the person assumes a negative outcome will occur.",Fortune-telling
1233,I’m in my 3rd trimester and my mom seems to be a devil!,"""my mom seems to be a devil""","The phrase ""my mom seems to be a devil"" assigns a negative and extreme label to the mom based on the speaker's feelings or situation.

Additionally, the phrases 'I feel like I am not capable of doing anything' and 'I feel like the biggest waste' indicate negative self-labeling, which fits the 'Labeling' distortion. However, since the first phrase explicitly demonstrates 'should' thinking and is a core driver of the distress, the dominant distortion is 'Should statements'.",Should statements
1235,It makes me feel afraid to go to sleep and I usually end up being awake until the sun rises.,"""It makes me feel afraid to go to sleep"" and ""I usually end up being awake until the sun rises""","The statement describes an emotional response ('feel afraid') which is used as a basis to conclude a real-world consequence (difficulty sleeping). This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the feeling of fear is taken as evidence of reality (that sleep is unsafe or dangerous), rather than objective evidence. There is no prediction about the future (fortune-telling), no exaggerated black-and-white thinking (all-or-nothing), no labeling of self or others, no focusing only on negatives (mental filter), no assuming others' thoughts (mind reading), no generalized conclusions beyond the context, no personalization, and no 'should' statements.",Emotional Reasoning

Instead, it shows awareness of the need to avoid distortions.",No Distortion
1237,He’s a danger to us and a terrible father.,"""He’s a danger to us"" and ""a terrible father""","The statement assigns a negative global label ('terrible father') and characterizes the person as a threat ('danger to us'), which reflects a broad and fixed negative judgment about a person's character rather than specific actions or situations.

This is a core feature of 'Mind Reading' cognitive distortion. The frustration arising from this misinterpretation compounds the issue but does not indicate other distortions like Emotional Reasoning or Personalization specifically. The key distortion revolves around making assumptions about others’ emotions incorrectly.",Mind Reading
1242,"I’m sure this will sound absurd, but this is my situation. I do bring it up very often as I’m skeptical about how truthful he really is.",I do bring it up very often; I’m skeptical about how truthful he really is.,"The speaker expresses skepticism about the truthfulness of another person's statements. The phrase 'I do bring it up very often' shows continuous doubt, and 'how truthful he really is' implies the speaker assumes they know what the other person is thinking or feeling without direct evidence. This aligns with the cognitive distortion 'Mind Reading,' where one believes they know others' thoughts or intentions without confirmation.",Mind Reading

This reflects reasoning based on emotions or bodily sensations rather than objective evidence, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning. The person assumes that because they feel anxious or have a physical reaction, they must act to alleviate it, rather than recognizing the feeling as just an emotion.",Emotional Reasoning
1247,So these past couple months my Significant other seems to get angrier and angrier at things that are so simple.,my Significant other seems to get angrier and angrier at things that are so simple,"The statement indicates a trend over the past couple of months where the significant other is described as increasingly angry about simple things. The phrase 'seems to get angrier and angrier' implies a generalized conclusion about the significant other's behavior worsening over time. This is a broad, sweeping statement based on a few or multiple instances, rather than a single event. The speaker is making a generalized assumption about their partner's emotional state, which aligns with the concept of Overgeneralization, where one assumes a pattern or trend from limited evidence.",Overgeneralization

This situation feels like the rest of my life,"The speaker feels guilty due to being the only family member, which is a subjective feeling rather than an objective fact, indicating reliance on emotional state to draw conclusions. The phrase 'This situation feels like the rest of my life' shows they base their prediction about the future on current emotions. This matches 'Emotional Reasoning', where feelings are taken as evidence of truth. There is also an element of predicting future based on current emotions, but the primary distortion is Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
1250,I am terrified of life.,I am terrified of life,"The phrase indicates that the person's current emotional state (being terrified) is used as evidence that life itself is terrifying or dangerous. This means feelings are taken as factual truth without objective evidence, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning. The statement does not suggest an extreme either/or mindset (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future negatively (Fortune-telling), or assigning a negative global label to oneself or others (Labeling). Therefore, Emotional Reasoning is the most appropriate classification.",Emotional Reasoning

Phrases like 'either always depressed... or completely done' show a black-and-white perspective without nuance. Additionally, the belief that 'no one could do anything to change my view or the world' reflects a fixed, all-encompassing conclusion about the situation, reinforcing the extremity of the thinking.

1253,I felt like such a loser cuz everyone was communicating and didn’t even notice I was there.,"""I felt like such a loser""; ""everyone was communicating and didn’t even notice I was there""","The statement ""I felt like such a loser"" exemplifies labeling, where a negative global label is applied to oneself based on a specific event or feeling. The phrase ""everyone was communicating and didn’t even notice I was there"" suggests that the speaker is applying a negative label to themselves because of feeling ignored. This is not just emotional reasoning, which would imply the feeling itself is evidence; instead, the speaker is explicitly categorizing themselves negatively. It is not mind reading, because there's no claim about others' thoughts, and it is not fortune-telling since there is no prediction about the future.

However, despite this recognition, the individual feels unable to let go of the belief. This indicates a reliance on feelings rather than objective evidence to validate the belief. The person is reasoning emotionally ('I can’t shake this belief') rather than logically, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning—assuming that because they feel something, it must be true.",Emotional Reasoning
1255,It’s really bothering me right now because school is getting a lot harder and I feel like i can’t keep up.,school is getting a lot harder and I feel like I can’t keep up,"The key phrase 'I feel like I can’t keep up' reflects an interpretation of the situation based on current emotional state. The speaker is concluding that they cannot keep up because of their feelings of being bothered and challenged by school difficulty, rather than an objective assessment. This aligns with emotional reasoning, where feelings are taken as evidence for truth.",Emotional Reasoning

""I think my head will explode like a bomb.""","The first phrase suggests a broad, sweeping change indicating a complete shift in perspective, which could be interpreted as seeing things in black-or-white terms, but more importantly, the second phrase is an exaggerated, catastrophic thought about physical consequence ('head will explode like a bomb'), implying a tendency to magnify the intensity and severity of the experience. This reflects an overestimation of the negative outcome, which fits the definition of Magnification rather than other distortions like All-or-Nothing Thinking or Emotional Reasoning.",Magnification

These behaviors are indicative of the person labeling their experience as 'social anxiety' symptoms. The phrase 'what I would call social anxiety symptoms' shows the person is assigning a generalized label to their feelings and behaviors. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or personalization here. The focus is on how the individual categorizes their experience, which is consistent with the cognitive distortion known as Labeling.",Labeling

This indicates a tendency to disregard or deny their emotional experience suddenly, which is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning—judging reality based on feelings rather than objective evidence. They interpret their emotional reactions as invalid or nonexistent when told to calm down, reflecting emotional reasoning rather than a distortion like Mind Reading or Overgeneralization.",Emotional Reasoning

This represents applying a negative and global label to oneself based on thoughts and feelings rather than objective facts. The core distortion here is assigning a negative label ('psychopath', 'very bad person') to oneself, which aligns with the cognitive distortion 'Labeling'.",Labeling

This fear persists despite knowing rationally that the close people won’t hurt them. This reflects a reasoning pattern where feelings of fear and upset are taken as evidence that harm is likely to occur. Thus, the person is using their emotions as a basis for their belief about reality, which fits the definition of Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

The person is drawing a generalized, negative conclusion about their worth and existence from specific feelings and family dynamics. This is not simply labeling themselves or fortune-telling future events, but rather they are overgeneralizing their feelings of worthlessness and how they think life would be better without them. The key distortion is a broad negative generalization about themselves based on selective negative thoughts and feelings across many years.",Overgeneralization

This reflects a black-or-white or dichotomous view, where things are seen as either one way or the other, without middle ground or nuance. The phrase 'pretty much the only good choice' strongly indicates an all-or-nothing perspective rather than a balanced or nuanced view. There is no indication of emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, or other distortions. Thus, this fits best with All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

Additionally, the statement ""If he was in REAL treatment maybe things would be different but he doesn’t want things to change"" assumes the parent's unwillingness and explains the situation with a negative internal attribution that is not confirmed.

This reflects a polarized, black-and-white perception of thoughts and feelings. The language 'half of my mind' suggests a split with no middle ground or nuance, indicating extreme opposing viewpoints. The act of self-harm suggests an emotional coping response but does not define a distortion by itself. There is no evidence of prediction about the future (fortune-telling), labeling, or personal blame (personalization). Nor is there an emotional reasoning that concludes the thought must be true because of feelings, or magnification of one fact.

The key phrase 'I feel that I am being a terrible father' and 'I am not supporting my family correctly' indicate the speaker is interpreting their self-worth and role based on their emotions—feeling depressed and guilty leads them to conclude they are failing. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as evidence of truth. There is no indication of all-or-nothing extremes, fortune-telling, labeling a fixed identity beyond this emotional self-assessment, or other distortions. The self-criticism follows directly from the emotional state rather than an explicit overgeneralization, personalization beyond guilt, or should statements.",Emotional Reasoning

The individual concludes that because these efforts have not changed their feelings, they must hate themselves overall. This indicates a black-and-white approach to their situation, where partial effort or progress is ignored in favor of an all-encompassing negative conclusion. The repeated use of 'I hate myself' shows a global negative labeling and an absolute judgement, characteristic of all-or-nothing thinking rather than other distortions like emotional reasoning or magnification. The pattern of ignoring positive efforts and focusing only on an absolute negative self-assessment aligns best with All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This reflects an assumption about another person's feelings or thoughts without clear evidence, which aligns with 'Mind Reading'—believing you know what others are thinking or feeling. There is no evidence in the statement that the speaker is using extreme categories (all-or-nothing), predicting the future (fortune-telling), or interpreting emotions as facts (emotional reasoning). The fear stems from an assumed perception of others' feelings, characteristic of mind reading.",Mind Reading

This implies a judgment about how emotions 'should' be experienced. The statement then reveals the speaker actually feels those emotions, indicating a conflict with their internal 'rules' about feelings.

It just feels like she behaved recklessly and at the expense of my father.,"The statement reflects the speaker's inner questioning about blaming the therapist unfairly ('making a scapegoat'). The speaker feels that the therapist acted recklessly and harmed their father. This feeling is based on an emotional reaction ('It just feels like'). There is no exaggeration of the situation, nor is there a broad generalization or labeling beyond the specific behavior. The focus is on emotional interpretation rather than factual analysis or assumptions about future events. The phrase 'It just feels like' highlights that the speaker's judgment is influenced by their current emotional state, which is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, predicting the future, labeling oneself or others negatively, magnifying or filtering details, mind reading, personalization, or using 'should' statements. Instead, the reasoning is based clearly on the emotional experience (it felt like...), which aligns with Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

The statement generalizes the difficulties faced in multiple areas (leaving, connecting with others, family issues) as stemming from stigmas, suggesting a heightened perception of their effects. This amplification of negative consequences aligns with magnification rather than other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking (which involves absolute terms), personalization (blaming oneself exclusively), or emotional reasoning (basing reality solely on feelings). Therefore, the most suitable distortion is Magnification.",Magnification

This aligns with the distortion of 'Fortune-telling,' where the person assumes they know what will happen. The expression of deep regret is emotional but not itself a distortion. The concern about others thinking they could get away with tormenting is more about a desire for justice rather than a cognitive distortion.

This is a type of thinking where the outcome is viewed in absolute terms — either complete love if trying hard enough, or no love at all if not. This reflects a black-and-white or dichotomous view, characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking.

The key phrase 'Every time she does something that irritates me' suggests a repetitive negative outcome linked directly to her actions. The speaker expresses intense emotions (anger, crying, whispering hatred).

The individual feels controlled by their anger and believes that minor incidents consistently provoke a strong rage response leading to harmful actions.

This reflects a distorted perception of reality rather than a cognitive distortion about thinking patterns. There is also implicit emotional reasoning about the fear, but primarily the statement contains an assumption about another person's reaction which is not known for certain.

The speaker focuses on the negative aspects ('little things just send me into a negative mood') and generalizes these feelings to 'most days' and 'everything becomes a chore.' This indicates filtering out positive experiences and focusing on the negatives.

However, since the blame assignment for the suicide attempts places responsibility on the mother (externalizing), it aligns more with Personalization, where the individual connects their difficulties directly to others' actions or characteristics. The intense negative characterization of the mother fits Labeling as well, but the primary distortion is the personalization of responsibility for the speaker's own actions on the mother.",Personalization

This reflects a tendency to view themselves in an absolute, unchanging way and to generalize their lifelong experience as being dominated entirely by one condition.

This suggests the speaker is personalizing the situation by taking responsibility (or blame) for something that may not be entirely within their control or that is influenced by someone else.

The individual interprets their intense fear and resulting behavior (being mean and closed off) as a direct consequence of their upbringing. They assume that their fear will cause a negative outcome (ending up with someone like their dad) without concrete evidence, which reflects predicting negative future events.

This reflects an anticipation or prediction of a negative outcome (developing schizophrenia) without certainty. The fear is based on the assumption that because symptoms occurred before, they will inevitably lead to schizophrenia.

The phrase 'I’ve felt like this since I was 16' and 'I can’t remember the last time I really felt something' suggest the individual is generalizing this emotional state across a long time period without exception. This indicates a broad negative conclusion based on a single type of experience, which aligns most closely with 'Overgeneralization,' where the person applies one negative experience to their overall emotional state and timeline.

1380,One of my therapist I literally feel he kidnapped me from my body with my mother and created an induced schizophrenia and rape us.,"""One of my therapist I literally feel he kidnapped me from my body with my mother and created an induced schizophrenia and rape us.""","The statement expresses a deeply intense and distorted perception of reality, where the speaker attributes extreme and highly unlikely actions (kidnapping from their body, induced schizophrenia, rape) to their therapist and mother. This reflects a severe misinterpretation of events and may come from emotional distress or paranoia. The speaker is assuming malicious intent and actions without evidence, possibly jumping to extreme conclusions about others' intentions and actions. This fits the category of 'Personalization' because the speaker is taking external situations and interpreting them as personally targeted or caused by others specifically toward them, in an exaggerated and distorted manner.",Personalization
1381,I always feel like someone is going to hurt me and I am extremely guarded.,"""I always feel like someone is going to hurt me"" and ""I am extremely guarded""","The phrase ""I always feel like someone is going to hurt me"" indicates a prediction about future events without concrete evidence, specifically expecting harm to occur. This aligns with the cognitive distortion of Fortune-telling, where one predicts negative outcomes. Additionally, the feeling of being extremely guarded is a behavioral response to this predicted harm. The statement does not represent all-encompassing thinking (All-or-Nothing), interpreting emotions as facts (Emotional Reasoning), assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading), or other distortions. Therefore, the core distortion is making a negative prediction without evidence.",Fortune-telling

This is characteristic of 'Personalization,' where someone attributes external events or other people's behaviors to themselves without considering other contributing factors. The statement does not show typical features of other distortions such as all-or-nothing thinking or fortune-telling.",Personalization

It assumes a specific negative outcome will happen as a direct consequence of accepting the gift, without evidence that it will always be the case. This reflects predicting a negative future (feeling bad, owing, and receiving weird requests) based on a current action (accepting the gift).

The second phrase describes a dissociative feeling, highlighting an emotional experience rather than a logical conclusion.

The second phrase shows the fear of making the wrong decision about the future, which is also predicting an unfavorable event without certainty. The individual is assuming a negative outcome (killing themselves by 30, making the wrong decision in life) without concrete proof, which aligns with the distortion of 'fortune-telling.' This is distinct from other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking (which involves black-and-white extremes), labeling (attributing a global negative label), or emotional reasoning (basing reality on feelings).

This is clearly labeling, where the individual defines themselves with harsh, global terms ('insane', 'psychopathy', 'deranged soul'). While there is an element of all-encompassing negative self-view, the core cognitive distortion is the rigid use of negative labels to define the self. The statement is not about predicting future events (fortune-telling) or magnifying a specific event, but about assigning a negative identity.",Labeling

However, the focus is on his persistent worry and inability to stop thinking about something said or worrying, which aligns with fortune-telling—expecting or imagining negative outcomes or situations without concrete evidence. Additionally, the mention that girls do not hang out with him but prefer richer, popular boys suggests an assumption about social rejection without confirmed facts, which is also related to fortune-telling or mind reading but mostly fortune-telling since it predicts continual social exclusion. Other distortions such as labeling or overgeneralization are less fitting as there is no clear global negative label or sweeping conclusion. The primary distortion here is Fortune-telling because the person assumes negative social outcomes and persistent worry based on imagined scenarios.",Fortune-telling

It does not exaggerate or catastrophize the forgetfulness (ruling out Magnification), nor does it jump to conclusions about future outcomes (ruling out Fortune-telling). There is no evidence of generalizing the forgetfulness to all areas of life or times (ruling out Overgeneralization). The speaker is simply noticing a fact based on their current experience, without labeling themselves negatively or thinking in absolutes. Therefore, the statement reflects an accurate self-appraisal without cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

This uses assumptions about the future without evidence, essentially forecasting a negative event. The key distortion is making a negative prediction about future events without concrete proof, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling'. The person is expecting the worst outcome based on fear rather than facts.",Fortune-telling

The claim that anxiety was always present and masked due to fear of judgment suggests a pattern derived from past events being extended as a general truth without exceptions. This aligns with overgeneralization, where a single negative theme (the bad childhood and subsequent anxiety) is applied broadly to the speaker's life experience. There is no evidence of predicting future events (fortune-telling), extreme binary thinking (all-or-nothing), or other distortions like mind reading or labeling in this statement.",Overgeneralization
1397,Been a nightmare since I moved here.,Been a nightmare since I moved here,"The phrase 'Been a nightmare since I moved here' suggests a global negative evaluation of the entire experience since moving.

It generalizes the situation to an absolute negative state, indicating an overgeneralization distortion rather than a more specific one like emotional reasoning or labeling.",Overgeneralization
1398,"All the day, I would keep worrying about all these problems, which would give me butterflies.","keep worrying about all these problems, which would give me butterflies","The statement shows continuous worrying about multiple problems, creating anxiety ('butterflies'). This reflects an exaggerated focus on negative aspects (problems) and intensifying their emotional impact. The phrase 'keep worrying about all these problems' suggests an overemphasis on the negative without balancing with positive or neutral information, which aligns with magnification—blowing things out of proportion emotionally.",Magnification

They are essentially making a negative judgment or label about themselves for acting in ways that don't align with their past identity or self-image. This reflects the cognitive distortion known as Labeling, where one assigns a global negative label to oneself based on specific behaviors, rather than seeing the behavior as situational or changeable.",Labeling

I have no actual friends and even school idiots ridicule me.,"""everyone is hostile toward me"", ""I have no actual friends"", ""school idiots ridicule me""",The statement includes a broad generalization about social interactions: 'everyone is hostile toward me' and 'I have no actual friends'. This indicates the speaker is taking specific negative experiences or feelings and applying them universally to all people around him. The use of absolute terms like 'everyone' and a total lack of friends suggests the distortion is overgeneralizing from limited instances to a sweeping negative conclusion about his entire social world.,Overgeneralization

I have tried to figure what I am mad or frustrated about but have no idea what it is.,"""constantly frustrated beyond words"", ""have no idea why"", ""tried to figure out what I am mad or frustrated about but have no idea what it is""","The statement expresses a strong emotional state ('constantly frustrated beyond words') without a clear understanding or evidence of what is causing it. The individual attempts to identify the cause but fails, indicating confusion rather than assuming or interpreting based on emotions. The frustration is acknowledged without inferring specific negative outcomes or fault. This suggests the person is experiencing an emotional state without misattributing it or exaggerating specific causes, which rules out distortions like Emotional Reasoning (since they do not conclude based solely on feelings), Mind Reading, Fortune-telling, or Labeling. They also do not engage in all-or-nothing thinking or personalization here. The key is that the emotion exists without an explanation, and the individual does not jump to distorted conclusions but simply expresses confusion. This aligns most closely with 'No Distortion' as the statement is a straightforward report of feelings and awareness of uncertain cause.",No Distortion

This goes beyond a single behavior to a pervasive negative self-view, which is characteristic of labeling—a cognitive distortion where one assigns a fixed, global label to oneself based on specific actions or feelings. Although there is mention of anger and inability to control it, the dominant theme is the negative, holistic self-label, not emotional reasoning or other distortions.",Labeling

It does not imply an absolute 'all-or-nothing' perspective, nor does it generalize a single event. Instead, it is a straightforward description of mood variability, without assumptions about cause, consequence, or character. There is no evidence of interpreting feelings as facts (emotional reasoning), predicting the future (fortune-telling), labeling oneself or others, magnifying negatives, filtering selectively, mind reading, personalization, or use of 'should' statements.

This reflects assuming knowledge of someone else's intentions, which aligns with 'Mind Reading'. It is not a prediction about the future (Fortune-telling), nor is it an extreme all-or-nothing view or labeling. There is no evidence of emotional reasoning or personalization here. Rather, the individual assumes they know the spouse's hidden motives, fitting 'Mind Reading'.",Mind Reading

The phrase 'i get angry, very fast' and 'it doesn’t take that much for me to want to kill someone' shows an extreme, absolute viewpoint rather than a nuanced one. Saying 'i cant control anything about me' goes beyond a single instance and applies a blanket judgment toward their entire self-control capacity.

The phrase ""was bullied a lot"" combined with repeated negative labels like ""ugly"" and ""fat"" plus being told to kill themselves suggests the speaker is generalizing their social experiences in middle school as uniformly bad and harmful. This indicates a pattern of overgeneralizing from specific negative events to a broad and lasting negative conclusion about their social life and self-worth.",Overgeneralization

This reasoning connects emotional states directly to suicidal ideation, implying that the feeling of boredom is essentially a sufficient cause for the extreme conclusion. This reflects reasoning based on feelings rather than objective evidence or broader context, aligning with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as proof of reality without sufficient logical basis.

The person is drawing a conclusion about their mental state based mainly on their emotional reaction and internal experience, rather than objective evidence. This is demonstrated by the anxiety triggered by an inner voice and the fear that they are slipping into madness. The interpretation relies heavily on their feelings ('This scared me' and 'I feel as though I'm slipping into madness'), suggesting that their emotional state is driving their belief.

1410,Everything was perfect except the fact that he was cheating on his girlfriend with me and our relationship was a secret.,Everything was perfect except the fact that he was cheating on his girlfriend with me and our relationship was a secret.,"The statement uses 'Everything was perfect except...' which shows a splitting between 'perfect' and the negative aspect of cheating. This reflects a tendency to see situations in black-and-white terms without a middle ground. Although the sentence acknowledges one positive (everything was perfect), it immediately negates it because of one negative fact, which aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking.

This indicates predicting a negative future outcome without certainty, which aligns with fortune-telling. The other parts of the statement acknowledge living life and being able to ignore the feeling, showing some realistic appraisal rather than all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or other distortions.

This indicates a pattern of taking specific instances or difficulties and extending them to a generalized, permanent inability across all time and situations. There is no indication of temporary feelings (emotional reasoning), predicting the future (fortune-telling), or making assumptions about others' thoughts (mind reading).

This reflects a negative conclusion about their life situation based mainly on their current relationship status. However, the person is predicting that their life has been limited or deprived in a broad way due to this specific circumstance, without evidence to confirm all possible life experiences they might be missing. This is an example of 'Fortune-telling' because the speaker is predicting a negative outcome or experience (missing out on life) based on their current behavior or situation.",Fortune-telling

They see the failure as completely ruining their year and opportunities, rather than viewing it as a setback with possible future recovery. This reflects an all-or-nothing perspective where the situation is seen in black-or-white terms rather than nuances. The persistent depressive and lonely feelings suggest the cognitive distortion is influencing their emotional state.

Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low.,"""I have never got love"", ""my self esteem is gone way low""","The statement ""I have never got love"" generalizes a personal experience into a universal condition, implying that love has never been received at any time. This is an overgeneralization because a specific or limited experience is taken to represent the entirety of the person's experiences. The consequence mentioned, ""my self esteem is gone way low,"" follows from this generalized belief but does not itself constitute a different distortion.",Overgeneralization

The speaker is experiencing a negative emotion and questioning it in the context of objectively good life conditions. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where a person assumes their feelings reflect the true nature of reality (feeling ashamed must mean there is something wrong despite evidence to the contrary). The statement does not generalize excessively, predict the future, or include 'should' statements, and it is not labeling themselves in a fixed way but rather reacting emotionally.",Emotional Reasoning
1423,"But the thought often dominates my thoughts. Planning out how such an attack would go, thinking about how the media would react, ect.","Planning out how such an attack would go, thinking about how the media would react","The statement involves imagining specific future events occurring, such as an attack and the media's reaction to it, which indicates predicting or assuming outcomes without evidence. This aligns with the cognitive distortion of Fortune-telling, where someone anticipates negative or specific future scenarios as if they are certain.",Fortune-telling
1424,"While things in his life were not improving, our relationship was still going well. But the past few weeks it has taken a turn.","""While things in his life were not improving, our relationship was still going well. But the past few weeks it has taken a turn.""","The speaker acknowledges that things in his life were not improving but notes the relationship was still going well, showing some balanced thinking initially. However, the phrase ""But the past few weeks it has taken a turn"" suggests a shift in perception focused on recent negative change. There is no evidence of extreme polarization of events (no absolute good or bad), no assumption of knowing another's thoughts or feelings, no exaggeration beyond what is stated, no prediction about future outcomes, and no labeling. Instead, the statement reflects a recent observed change without unwarranted distortion. Therefore, there is no cognitive distortion present.",No Distortion
1425,I hate humans. They discust me and their motives confuse me.,"""I hate humans"", ""They disgust me"", ""their motives confuse me""","The statement expresses a strong negative feeling towards all humans, implying a global and absolute judgment without exceptions, which suggests an extreme generalization about a whole group based on emotions. The phrase 'I hate humans' indicates a blanket negative evaluation, aligning with overgeneralization rather than a single event or individual. The feelings of disgust and confusion about motives add emotional intensity but do not alone confirm Emotional Reasoning or Mind Reading. Labeling applies similarly but usually involves assigning a specific negative trait or name, whereas this statement involves an overall negative feeling about a broad group. Hence, the primary distortion is making a sweeping generalization about all humans.",Overgeneralization
1426,"In fact, I believe that my father planned everything before escaping back to his home country instead of “searching for work” there.",I believe that my father planned everything before escaping back to his home country instead of “searching for work” there.,"The statement involves assuming knowledge about the father's intentions and plans without direct evidence, implying certainty about his motives. This reflects the cognitive distortion of 'Mind Reading,' where one believes they know what another person is thinking or planning. The speaker presumes to understand the father's intent ('planned everything') rather than acknowledging uncertainty or alternative explanations.",Mind Reading
1427,These weird invisible people are really overwhelming me and are making it so I can’t focus at all in class.,"""weird invisible people"", ""really overwhelming me"", ""can't focus at all in class""","The statement describes the presence of 'weird invisible people' who are 'really overwhelming' the speaker and causing an inability to focus. This reflects the speaker's interpretation of an internal or external experience without concrete evidence but based instead on an emotional sense of being overwhelmed. The 'invisible people' are likely a metaphor or perception that leads the speaker to feel distressed, and their feeling of being overwhelmed leads them to conclude they cannot focus. This is a clear example of Emotional Reasoning, where the speaker's feelings (overwhelmed) are taken as proof of reality (inability to focus caused by these 'people'). There is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or fortune-telling, and the distortion centers on using emotion as evidence.",Emotional Reasoning

The statement reflects a belief about what is expected or required of the speaker in her role as an older sister. This fits the cognitive distortion known as 'Should statements', where someone imposes rigid rules or expectations on themselves or others, often leading to guilt or pressure.",Should statements
1429,"They laugh that I spend my time searching up universities in other countries because I want to get far, far away from here. Even the school counselor laughs at me, and I feel like I’m not worth saying that I have problems.",They laugh that I spend my time searching up universities in other countries; Even the school counselor laughs at me; I feel like I’m not worth saying that I have problems.,"The statement involves interpreting others' laughter as a personal devaluation ('I feel like I’m not worth'), which suggests the person is assuming they are inherently unworthy based on others' reactions. The belief that others laugh specifically at them implies an assumed negative intent or judgment by others without direct evidence. This reflects an assumption about others' thoughts and feelings without clear proof, fitting the definition of Mind Reading more than other distortions. The emotional response (feeling unworthy) stems from assuming others’ negative evaluation.",Mind Reading
1430,"I really can’t stop thinking about ending my life.

Phrases like 'My whole family hates me' reflect a global conclusion about everyone in the family from specific interactions or perceived behaviors. The statement that the brother 'acts like he cares about me when really doesn’t I can tell' is an assumption about others' feelings without direct evidence, which fits mind reading. However, since the emphasis is on a broad negative conclusion about the whole group (the entire family hates me), this represents overgeneralization more strongly than mind reading. The speaker takes a single or limited number of events or feelings and extends them universally to all family members, implying a negative universal truth.",Overgeneralization
1431,"I always considered this normal and human, especially for someone my age, but it’s gotten to the point where I honestly can’t tell the difference between what I really believe in and what I think I do.","""I honestly can’t tell the difference between what I really believe in and what I think I do""; ""always considered this normal and human, especially for someone my age""","The key phrase expresses confusion and uncertainty about one's own beliefs, indicating a struggle with internal clarity rather than a definitive negative or inaccurate conclusion about oneself or others. The phrase ""I always considered this normal"" suggests a generalization but it is qualified by 'especially for someone my age', so it lacks the absolutism typical of All-or-Nothing thinking. There is no explicit emotional reasoning (basing truth on feelings), fortune-telling (predicting the future), labeling (assigning global negative labels), magnification (exaggeration), mental filter (focusing on negatives only), mind reading (assuming others' thoughts), personalization (blaming oneself), or should statements (rigid rules). The statement mainly reflects difficulty discerning between one's true beliefs and perceived beliefs, which is more about internal confusion than a distortion listed here. However, the phrase ""I always considered this normal"" can be seen as an Overgeneralization, since the person is applying a past assumption universally over time or across contexts. The uncertainty and generalization about beliefs points best to Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
1432,"Hello, my boyfriend is great to me in person.",my boyfriend is great to me in person,"The statement makes a positive observation about the boyfriend's behavior 'in person,' without generalizing the behavior to all contexts, assuming feelings without evidence, or imposing absolutes.

The feeling of a gap that needs to be filled arises from the mother's mental health but is presented as a personal emotional experience rather than an objective fact. There is no evidence of an extreme all-or-nothing view, negative labeling, predicting the future, or mind reading. Instead, the speaker is interpreting their emotional state based on their feelings. This aligns with emotional reasoning, where feelings are taken as evidence of truth.",Emotional Reasoning

The key part is 'we argue about this because I bring up how uncomfortable I am,' which implies the speaker believes that bringing up their feelings is causing the argument. This reflects assuming personal responsibility for the argument without evidence that their actions are the cause, which is typical of Personalization. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or other distortions here.",Personalization
1435,"Though they both see psychiatrists for meds, neither are in therapy anymore since “it doesn’t work.”",neither are in therapy anymore since 'it doesn’t work.',"The statement indicates a conclusion that therapy 'doesn't work' based on their current situation.

I'm nice to most people, I write comedic songs, I perform these things and I try to like everyone, but I have this problem.","The speaker acknowledges multiple positive efforts and behaviors (trying to be extrovert, being nice to most people, creating and performing comedic songs, trying to like everyone) which indicates a balanced view of self-efforts. However, the concluding phrase 'but I have this problem' suggests a focus on a perceived problem despite all these positive actions. The statement does not indicate extreme black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), nor does it assign global negative labels to self or others (Labeling) or predict future events (Fortune-telling). There is no evidence of assuming others’ thoughts (Mind Reading) or excessive emotional reasoning. The speaker is not using 'should' or 'must' statements. Neither is there magnification of negative aspects alone, nor filtering out all positives. The phrase 'I've always tried' might hint at a generalization, but it refers to efforts rather than qualities or outcomes. Overall, the speaker recognizes positive behaviors but highlights a continuing problem, without evidence of distorted thinking described by the listed types.",No Distortion

I have no reason not to trust him and he is truly the sweetest man I know.,worrying about my boyfriend possibly cheating on me since we first started going out; I have no reason not to trust him; he is truly the sweetest man I know,"The statement shows that the person is worrying about their boyfriend cheating without any evidence or reason, despite acknowledging he is trustworthy and kind. This indicates they are predicting a negative future event ('possibly cheating') without factual basis. This fits the 'Fortune-telling' distortion, where an individual assumes or predicts a negative outcome despite lack of evidence.",Fortune-telling

The phrase 'It feels like' indicates that emotions or bodily sensations are being used to infer an external event. Additionally, the mention of twitching and unexplained anger highlights an emotional and bodily state that influences the speaker's perception. This aligns closely with 'Emotional Reasoning,' where the person assumes that because they feel a certain way, it must be true (e.g., the earth is moving or there is a reason for their anger despite no external cause). None of the other distortion types, such as Fortune-telling or Overgeneralization, fit as well since the focus is on interpreting reality through feelings rather than predictions or generalizations.",Emotional Reasoning
1439,I worked on myself for my own sake because I realized I had lost everything.,"""I had lost everything""","The phrase ""I had lost everything"" indicates an extreme and absolute interpretation of the situation, implying a total loss without exceptions or nuance.

Additionally, the paranoid feelings and imagined hostile scenarios reinforce a belief based on assumed thoughts and intentions of others rather than facts. There is no clear indication of All-or-Nothing Thinking, Fortune-telling (predicting the future negatively), or Personalization in blaming self for events directly. The predominant distortion is assuming intentions and thoughts of others without concrete proof, which defines Mind Reading.",Mind Reading
1442,"i have problem with my temper and i grew up with a bad tempered father, i easily snapped when something really irritated me",problem with my temper; grew up with a bad tempered father; easily snapped when irritated,"The statement identifies a personal problem with temper and links it to having a bad tempered father, implying the cause of the temper issues is inherited or learned from the environment. There is a recognition of reacting strongly (snapping) to irritation. This reflects a causal attribution based on past experiences. There is no evidence of absolute thinking (all-or-nothing), predicting the future (fortune-telling), mind reading, or should statements. The statement focuses on the influence of upbringing on personal behavior, which aligns most closely with 'Personalization' as the person is linking their emotional reactions directly to their father’s bad temper as a cause for their own temper problem.",Personalization

The expectation that coworkers will hate the speaker if they say something reflects a prediction without evidence about others' feelings or reactions, which is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling'. There is also an element of 'Mind Reading' in assuming coworkers' thoughts or feelings (hating the speaker) without confirmation. However, the core cognitive distortion here is the prediction about future rejection based on the speaker’s actions, which aligns mostly with 'Fortune-telling'.",Fortune-telling

""I haven’t talked to anybody about it"" supports that the speaker hasn't confirmed others' knowledge. This reflects a cognitive distortion where the person assumes they know what others think or know without actual proof. Additionally, feeling ""stupid and ashamed"" because of this belief indicates the speaker is drawing emotional conclusions based on presumed thoughts of others. This fits the definition of Mind Reading, where a person assumes they know what others think, often in a negative way.",Mind Reading

1446,I can’t remember the last time I was relaxed or completely free of these pains.,I can’t remember the last time I was relaxed or completely free of these pains.,"The statement focuses on the speaker's inability to recall any recent moments of relaxation or being pain-free. This suggests a selective focus on negative experiences, filtering out any positive instances that might have occurred. The key aspect is the emphasis on a potentially continuous negative experience by ignoring or not recalling any positive exceptions.

Mainly I just don’t want to go through the horrific withdrawal effects.,Literally the only thing I desperately need is a prescription; I just don’t want to go through the horrific withdrawal effects.,"The phrase 'Literally the only thing I desperately need' suggests the speaker is viewing their situation in absolute terms, implying that nothing else matters or is important except getting the prescription. This reflects an 'all-or-nothing' mindset where the complexity of the situation is reduced to one essential need. Additionally, the description of withdrawal effects as 'horrific' shows an emotional reaction, but the main cognitive distortion is the absolutist thinking about their need.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The speaker is assuming that things will continue to deteriorate rapidly without evidence. Additionally, the split view of the self into two extremes ('one kind person and one mean, angry version of myself') might suggest All-or-Nothing Thinking or Labeling. However, the key statement about the worsening and the emotional sense of overwhelming anger as a prediction about change supports Fortune-telling more strongly.",Fortune-telling
1449,"Also, I often find myself faced with a deep and powerful hatred toward myself and my mind is often consumed with the notion that I deserve to die.",deep and powerful hatred toward myself; mind is consumed with the notion that I deserve to die,"The statement reflects intense negative emotions about the self, specifically self-hatred, and a consuming belief that the person deserves death. This suggests that the individual is drawing conclusions about their worthiness or value based solely on their feelings. This fits with the definition of Emotional Reasoning, where one assumes that their emotional state reflects objective reality. The statement does not fit other distortions like Labeling (which involves assigning a global negative label), All-or-Nothing Thinking (which involves dichotomous thinking), or Fortune-telling (predicting future events). Instead, the person is equating their negative feelings with an absolute truth about deserving to die, which is classic Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

I have no interest in friendship or relationships. I feel very emotionally cold and distant. I have difficulty understanding what emotion I am feeling at any given time, and I lack empathy.","The statement describes a range of emotional experiences and perceptions, including feelings of detachment, alienation, emotional coldness, and diminished emotions. However, the speaker does not make absolute or polarized judgments, nor do they jump to conclusions about the future or others' thoughts. There is no evidence of labeling themselves or others with a negative global term, no all-encompassing negative filter, and no exaggerated or personal attribution of blame in social contexts. Instead, the speaker is reporting subjective emotional experiences without cognitive distortion but expressing difficulty in emotional awareness and empathy. This suggests more of a description of affective state rather than a distortion. Therefore, the most fitting classification given the options is 'No Distortion.'",No Distortion

This is characteristic of Fortune-telling, where the person assumes they know what will happen in the future in a negative light.

They are applying one feeling broadly and consistently without specific situational context. The statement ""it seems to be getting worse"" suggests concern about future worsening but is based on current perception rather than definite prediction, so it falls short of full fortune-telling.

They equate their feeling of indifference to being hit by a car—a serious event—with a reality or truth about their mindset or life situation. This is a cognitive distortion where emotions are used as evidence for reality, rather than considering the feeling as just a temporary emotional experience.

This indicates a pattern of overgeneralizing a single piece of evidence into a wide, global conclusion about self-worth and the entire future, which aligns with the definition of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
1468,My Dad and I usually get on quite well.,"""My Dad and I usually get on quite well.""","The key phrase 'usually get on quite well' suggests a general positive statement about the relationship. The term 'usually' implies that there may be exceptions, indicating a balanced view rather than an extreme or absolute statement. There is no indication of distortion like overgeneralization (which would require a sweeping statement), all-or-nothing thinking (absolute terms), or any of the other listed distortions. The statement reflects a realistic and moderate perspective.",No Distortion
1469,"For years now, I’ve been feeling hate towards everything, people, myself, live, friendship.","For years now, I’ve been feeling hate towards everything, people, myself, life, friendship.","The statement involves a broad, sweeping negative judgment ('hate towards everything') that extends universally to multiple aspects (everything, people, myself, life, friendship). This generalization is applied without exceptions, reflecting a pattern of seeing all elements negatively. This aligns with overgeneralization, where a single or limited experience is generalized to an overall negative view of many areas. There is no indication that the person is predicting the future (fortune-telling), attributing blame specifically to themselves without cause (personalization), or using emotional reasoning to assume truths based solely on feelings. Rather, the emphasis is on a comprehensive, absolute negative evaluation.",Overgeneralization
1470,There are two sides of me. There’s the one thinking that I should have a relationship but the other side of me doesn’t want anything at all and by even thinking about being in a realitonship makes that side of me sick.

The phrase 'I should have a relationship' clearly indicates the presence of 'should statements,' which involve imposing rigid expectations or rules on oneself or others. The speaker is wrestling with an imposed obligation rather than an objective evaluation, which aligns with the cognitive distortion of 'Should statements.' None of the other distortions fit as closely since there is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, labeling, magnification, mental filter, mind reading, overgeneralization, or personalization in the provided statement.",Should statements
1471,I think my aunt feels that because I lost the one person who was always on my side that she can treat me whatever way she pleases.,my aunt feels that because I lost the one person who was always on my side that she can treat me whatever way she pleases,"The statement assumes the aunt's feelings and intentions without concrete evidence, specifically that she thinks the speaker is now vulnerable and can be treated poorly. This reflects 'Mind Reading,' where one believes they know what another person is thinking or feeling without confirmation. Although it also touches on personalization (linking the aunt's behavior to the speaker's loss), the core distortion is the assumption about the aunt's internal state and motives.",Mind Reading

This indicates taking personal blame for something outside their control, fitting the definition of Personalization, where an individual believes they are the cause of external events unjustifiably.",Personalization

They express distress over ongoing symptoms despite medication. There is no evidence of catastrophic future prediction (Fortune-telling), extreme black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), excessive blame (Personalization), filtering out positives (Mental filter), or assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading). The focus is on a real experience and frustration with treatment failure, without emotional justification of truth (Emotional Reasoning) or use of 'should' statements. The speaker does not generalize broadly or magnify issues excessively. The key aspect is rejecting a label based on self-awareness, which aligns with resisting Labeling distortion.",Labeling

It reflects a perception or interpretation of cognitive or emotional processes rather than making categorical judgments or predictions, personal blame, or negative labeling. The person is describing an internal mental experience without distorting it into a broad, absolute negative evaluation. There is no evidence of extreme black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future negatively (Fortune-telling), assigning global negative labels (Labeling), or other listed distortions. Instead, it articulates a difficulty in mental clarity and self-awareness without imposing an evaluative cognitive distortion. Therefore, the statement does not clearly fit any of the specified cognitive distortion categories.",No Distortion

It was such a dreadful panic.","I could think things into being, see the future, and I’d caused the death of my grandfather by picking up a penny which’d been facing tails-up.","The speaker believes they have the power to predict or influence future events with their thoughts, specifically causing a negative outcome (death of grandfather) by a seemingly unrelated action (picking up a penny). This reflects a form of making negative predictions about the future or assuming knowledge of future events without evidence, which aligns with the distortion known as 'Fortune-telling'.",Fortune-telling

Additionally, the dismissal of the value of ""any of the frivolous"" things further supports this broad negative generalization. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking (which involves extremes like 'always' or 'never' applied to behavior), but overgeneralization fits well as the person is making a broad negative judgment about their entire life and all aspects of certain things.",Overgeneralization

Additionally, the statement 'they’ve been starting to think I’m annoying' reflects an assumption about others' thoughts without concrete evidence, signifying mind reading. However, the dominant distortion is overgeneralization as the speaker concludes constant exclusion and negative perception from limited or evolving interactions.",Overgeneralization

This fits the cognitive distortion known as 'Labeling,' where an individual assigns a global negative label to themselves instead of describing specific behaviors. The second part about sex and damnation reflects a belief stemming from external messages rather than a cognitive distortion about thinking patterns, so the primary distortion here is the self-labeling as 'socially weird.'",Labeling

""I feel like I have lost my identity.""","The speaker is interpreting their emotional uncertainty as a frightening and significant problem ('scares the hell out of me'), which suggests they are using their emotional state as evidence that something is seriously wrong. This is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are treated as facts. The statement does not reflect all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or the other listed distortions, but rather the distortion that feelings alone indicate reality. The request for techniques to feel calm and think rationally supports the presence of Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

However, the key cognitive distortion appears when the individual shifts blame or interprets others’ behavior as inherently flawed ('there was something wrong with them for not understanding') which indicates attributing negative traits or intentions to others without clear evidence. This matches with 'Labeling' — assigning fixed negative characteristics to oneself or others. While there are some elements of emotional reasoning ('I hated myself') and personalization (feeling targeted by bullying), the primary distortion lies in the labeling of oneself as 'different' in a negative way and labeling others as 'something wrong' for not understanding.",Labeling

The key cognitive distortion here involves making an emotional interpretation ('I feel like I am possessed') as factual without objective evidence. This aligns with 'Emotional Reasoning,' where feelings are taken as evidence of truth. The individual infers loss of control through an emotional lens rather than objective reality. Other distortions like Magnification or Overgeneralization are less precise because the focus is on interpreting emotions as facts rather than exaggerating or generalizing events.",Emotional Reasoning

The person assumes they know what others intend (poisoning, killing), which fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling' (predicting negative outcomes without sufficient evidence). It is not 'Mind Reading' since the focus is on future events rather than current thoughts or feelings of others. It's not 'Emotional Reasoning' because the statement does not explicitly rely on feelings as evidence for truth. The statement expresses fearful anticipation of harmful events, reflecting negative forecasting.",Fortune-telling

""When I express that I need help they blatantly ignore me"" reinforces this perceived neglect. The person acknowledges causing the situation themselves, indicating some personal responsibility awareness and ruling out pure external blaming. The emotional reaction ""it hurts"" reflects emotional reasoning but does not dominate the thought process. The key cognitive distortion here is the assumption that 'they all hate me' without proof, which fits the 'Mind Reading' distortion where one believes they know what others think or feel.",Mind Reading

The key distortion is 'Mind Reading,' where the speaker presumes to know what the kids felt based solely on their own behavior, rather than any explicit communication or factual information.",Mind Reading
1489,Also some people cause me soo much anxiety I would have to selfharm.,some people cause me soo much anxiety I would have to selfharm,"The statement assumes a direct, causal relationship between the presence of certain people and the necessity to self-harm as a consequence.

The individual is reasoning from their emotional state (anxiety) to a dangerous outcome (self-harm), which aligns with Emotional Reasoning — interpreting feelings as factual indicators of reality without other evidence.",Emotional Reasoning

This suggests the person is labeling themselves negatively based on their academic challenges. There is also an implied absolute judgment on their entire worth tied to current failures. Although elements of overgeneralization and emotional reasoning are present, the core distortion is labeling—a harsh, global self-judgment.",Labeling

This suggests a filtering of experiences to primarily negative emotions, ignoring any neutral or positive feelings. There is also self-labeling in terms of 'I apparently dissociate' and 'I may hoard some things.' However, the dominant pattern is focusing on a narrow set of negative emotions and disregarding others, which fits the mental filter distortion, where a person filters out positive or neutral information and focuses only on the negative.",Mental filter

I bet nobody would miss me either.,feel like I’m a waste of life; I should just leave; I bet nobody would miss me either,"The sentence reflects a negative self-judgment with the phrase 'I’m a waste of life,' which indicates labeling oneself negatively. The statement 'I should just leave so I’d be out of their way' includes a 'should' statement, implying a rigid rule or demand on oneself. The phrase 'I bet nobody would miss me either' assumes the thoughts and feelings of others without evidence, which is mind reading. However, the dominant cognitive distortion is 'Labeling,' as the core of the statement is a global negative label about the self.

The speaker infers that the teacher is minimizing their feelings and that they themselves shouldn't be upset. This involves interpreting the teacher's thoughts/intentions without direct evidence, which aligns with assuming what others think.

The person generalizes their difficulty with people and anxiety to the entire work situation over a 3-month period.

The person experiences a cycle of positive and negative self-evaluations rather than a consistent extreme. This indicates an instability in self-image rather than a rigid black-and-white outlook. There is no indication that the person is using emotional evidence to define reality exclusively (emotional reasoning), nor is there prediction of future events (fortune-telling), or assigning fixed negative labels. The key issue is the frequent switching between feeling good and feeling ugly, indicating a pattern of extremes but not absolute extremes sustained at one time. However, the cycle itself shows the presence of negative thoughts generalizing beyond singular events, pointing towards overgeneralization or fluctuating evaluations. The key phrase 'goes on like this on and on again' implies a repetitive negative pattern beyond isolated incidents. The description does not clearly fit All-or-Nothing thinking which would require rigid extremes without fluctuation. The pattern involves a recurring theme of negative self-judgment following positive feelings, which aligns most closely with Overgeneralization, where the person generalizes a negative self-view repeatedly over time, causing distress.",Overgeneralization

These are internal emotional experiences that the person is interpreting as facts about their mental state. The use of phrases like 'I feel as if' and descriptions of the brain feeling 'foggy' and 'disconnected' indicate the person is relying heavily on their emotional state to infer their cognitive condition. There is no exaggeration or generalization about occurrences, no predictions about the future, no assigning of blame or fault, and no rigid all-or-nothing perspective.

The use of 'ever' emphasizes an absolute condition without exceptions. This indicates a sweeping conclusion based on specific instances (never crying at movies or books) extended to a global self-assessment ('I seem to lack sympathy and empathy').

The speaker infers the diagnosis based on slow work, limited social circle, limited enjoyment of activities, and sensitivity to noise at night. This involves assuming knowledge of the person's internal emotional state and thoughts without explicit confirmation from him. The speaker essentially believes they know what the person is feeling and thinking based on external signs alone, which fits the pattern of 'Mind Reading' cognitive distortion. The other distortions do not closely fit: it’s not all-or-nothing thinking since no extremes are stated; it’s not labeling because the speaker does not use a derogatory label but rather a clinical hypothesis; it’s not emotional reasoning because the inference is not made solely from the speaker’s emotions; it’s not fortune-telling since no future is predicted; no magnification or mental filter is evident since multiple facts are considered; no personalization since it’s about another person; no should statements are present.",Mind Reading

The person also highlights multiple negative behaviors and outcomes (overeating, weight gain, poor academic performance) and then concludes with an extreme outcome 'Suicide seems like the best option now.' This suggests a pattern of viewing experiences in absolute, extreme terms. However, the main cognitive distortion evident is the overgeneralization of problems and feelings - attributing ongoing constant urges and worsening conditions as an overall pervasive and unchangeable reality.

It is not Fortune-telling as they are not predicting future outcomes, but rather self-diagnosing based on present emotional evidence.",Emotional Reasoning

I actually avoid cooking eggs now because I suck at flipping them. I still have happy moments through-out the day. My days are just very up and down. I feel like I have no passion left except for anger and random ideas that I’ll never actually get around to or finish.

They acknowledge still having happy moments, but the overall tone emphasizes negatives, indicating a selective focus on negative events and feelings. This selective attention to negative details, while neglecting positive or neutral information, suggests a 'Mental filter' distortion more than any other. It’s not absolute (not All-or-Nothing), not labeling themselves entirely, not assuming to know the future (fortune-telling), and not leading from emotional reasoning alone. The focus on negative elements overshadowing the whole experience aligns best with 'Mental filter'.",Mental filter

This reflects an assumption about future feelings without current evidence. The speaker is effectively predicting an emotional response or lack thereof in a future event. This aligns closely with the cognitive distortion known as 'Fortune-telling', where one predicts negative or emotionally significant outcomes without sufficient basis.",Fortune-telling

They extend a single experience—being unable to cry during a painful injury—into a broad conclusion about their entire emotional expression pattern without acknowledging any exceptions or variations.

There is no evidence of exaggerating negatives (Magnification), assuming intentions without evidence (Mind Reading), or expecting a certain future outcome (Fortune-telling).

The statement does not demonstrate black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), an emotional-based conclusion without evidence (Emotional Reasoning), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), negative labeling of self or others (Labeling), exaggeration (Magnification), selective focus on negatives (Mental Filter), assuming others’ thoughts (Mind Reading), self-blame distorted by non-related events (Personalization), or prescriptive 'should' demands (Should statements).

I will burst out laughing for no reason.,"The individual expresses a mixture of emotional experiences and self-perceptions that suggest a negative interpretation of their internal state and social impact. The phrase 'People don’t understand' implies a perception that others are incapable of understanding them, which could hint at Mind Reading but is not strongly explicit. The statement 'I feel like im going mad' reflects emotional distress grounded in the person's feelings, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning — drawing conclusions about reality based solely on feelings. The contradictory self-labels 'ridiculously empathetic but also ridiculously insensitive' indicate a polarized, black-and-white view, which resembles All-or-Nothing Thinking. However, the statement does not indicate fortune-telling predictions about the future, labeling with a fixed negative label, or excessive magnification of specific events. The focus is on emotional experience validating the perception of going mad and hurting others.

The phrase 'I don’t want anyone else besides him' suggests an all-or-nothing stance on their relationship. The question about stress causing an episode reflects a search for an explanation but mainly emotional reasoning about partner's behavior.

This reflects the cognitive distortion of 'Labeling,' where a negative and extreme label is applied to oneself or others, overshadowing other aspects of identity or situation. The statement does not involve all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or other distortions like fortune-telling or personalization.

This aligns with the distortion of Labeling, where one assigns a fixed, negative label to oneself. The second phrase expresses a negative prediction about the future ('won’t ever be able to be naked or intimate with anyone again'), which could indicate Fortune-telling.

They assume a negative outcome (losing their mother, dad not taking good care) without definitive proof. They rely heavily on their anxious feelings to assess reality (becoming 'hysterical' signals imminent danger).

The hurt feeling shows an emotional impact but the primary distortion is the assumption of others' thoughts and feelings. The additional comments about making fun of his height reinforce ongoing negative judgments but do not create a new distortion type. Thus, the core distortion is Mind Reading.",Mind Reading

There is no evidence of interpreting feelings as facts (emotional reasoning), predicting the future (fortune-telling), assigning global negative labels, magnifying negatives, filtering out positives, mind reading, personalization, or imposing 'should' statements.

During these outbursts he rants about his mental condition, attacks my and my families insecurities and lifestyles, and even sometimes becomes violent over them. He even threatens suicide on more serious outbursts.","The statement describes a person experiencing frequent emotional outbursts involving rants, personal attacks, violence, and threats of suicide, tied to his mental condition. The speaker reports these behaviors but does not seem to interpret them with any cognitive bias or extract a distorted belief from these events themselves. Rather, the statement is observational, describing behaviors and emotional expressions as observed by the speaker. There is no evidence of cognitive distortion in the speaker's narration such as all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, labeling, etc. The statement does not indicate any inaccurate or biased thought pattern but is a factual report of another person's behavior and emotional state.",No Distortion
1590,Isn't everyone in this environment unfriendly?,"""everyone in this environment unfriendly""","The statement assumes that all people in the environment are unfriendly based on possibly limited experience or interactions. It generalizes a characteristic to an entire group without sufficient evidence, which is indicative of treating a few instances as representative of the whole category. This is a classic pattern of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
1591,"I'm so dizzy, I'm sick. I have to go to the hospital.","""I'm so dizzy"", ""I'm sick"", ""I have to go to the hospital""","The speaker interprets their physical sensation of dizziness as a definitive sign of being sick and requiring hospital care, without considering alternative explanations or waiting for further assessment. This indicates that they are basing their conclusion solely on their current emotional or physical state (feeling dizzy) and immediately assuming a severe medical condition. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where one believes that their emotions or physical sensations necessarily reflect reality.",Emotional Reasoning
1592,"I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry.","I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry.","The statement repeats the same phrases about being tired and hungry multiple times. This repetition suggests a possible focus on negative feelings without acknowledging any positive or neutral aspects. It may reflect a mental filter, where the speaker is concentrating solely on their physical discomforts and ignoring other experiences or feelings. The statement does not suggest all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, personalization, or other distortions as there is no generalization, judgment, or assumed causality. Instead, the emphasis on repeated negative internal states aligns best with a mental filter.",Mental filter

This reflects an extreme, absolute way of thinking without middle ground or alternatives, which is characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking. The person views the situation in black-and-white terms (either live by mom's plan or life is not worth living), which is a classic sign of this distortion.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1595,Was it a set-up for me to give me an incompetent job?,Was it a set-up for me to give me an incompetent job?,"The statement involves assuming the intention behind giving the job without concrete evidence, implying the speaker believes others are deliberately setting them up. This reflects an assumption about others' thoughts or motives (mind reading) but more strongly involves predicting a negative scenario without evidence, akin to fortune-telling about an impending negative situation. Since the speaker speculates a deliberate set-up, it aligns with predicting a negative future event rather than just guessing the thoughts of others. Therefore, the distortion closest to this is 'Fortune-telling.'",Fortune-telling
1596,"I just have to keep quiet so they don't laugh at me. We'll get bored one day, if I have to.","""I just have to keep quiet so they don't laugh at me."" and ""We'll get bored one day, if I have to.""","The first phrase assumes others are laughing at the speaker, which reflects the speaker's interpretation of others' thoughts without evidence. This is a classic example of Mind Reading, where the individual believes they know what others are thinking or feeling. The second phrase implies temporary endurance of the situation but does not introduce a new distortion. Therefore, the primary distortion present is Mind Reading.",Mind Reading
1597,We're usually busy. It's normal not to get in touch.,"""We're usually busy"", ""It's normal not to get in touch""","The key phrase 'We're usually busy' generalizes the situation to a frequent or typical state, implying a consistent pattern. The phrase 'It's normal not to get in touch' reinforces this generalization as an accepted norm. This shows taking a specific example of being busy and extending it broadly, which aligns with overgeneralization rather than a momentary or conditional judgment. There is no evidence of extreme black-and-white thinking, emotional assumptions, or other distortions such as mind reading or personalization here.",Overgeneralization
1598,"Anyway, I'm sick, so I'm just gonna rip my body out.","""I'm sick"" and ""I'm just gonna rip my body out""","The statement reflects a direct connection between the feeling of being sick and the drastic emotional response ""gonna rip my body out."" This demonstrates emotional reasoning because the speaker is letting the feeling of sickness dictate a severely negative conclusion about their bodily state. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, predicting the future, labeling, or other distortions. The reaction is based on the current emotional state, assuming it reflects an objective truth or an uncontrollable reality.",Emotional Reasoning
1599,My existence is superfluous. I've delayed everything else for him.,"""My existence is superfluous"", ""I've delayed everything else for him.""","The phrase ""My existence is superfluous"" implies an extreme negative self-judgment, suggesting the person feels completely unnecessary or without worth. This absolute evaluation aligns with black-and-white thinking seen in All-or-Nothing Thinking. The second phrase ""I've delayed everything else for him"" might suggest regret or personalization, but it is secondary to the primary absolutist statement. The dominant distortion centers around an extreme and absolute negative evaluation of self-worth, characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1600,I can't even make a friend. My life is really a failure.,"""I can't even make a friend."" and ""My life is really a failure.""","The first phrase implies a single difficulty (making friends) is generalized to a broad conclusion about the entire life being a failure. This indicates drawing a sweeping negative conclusion based on a limited experience, characteristic of overgeneralization. The statement does not reflect all-or-nothing thinking (which would involve absolute terms like always or never), nor labeling (which would assign a global negative identity to oneself), or other distortions. Instead, the reasoning involves extending a specific failure to an overall negative judgment about life.",Overgeneralization
1601,"These young people will get their jobs cut off, play with their boss, and they'll be punished sooner or later.","These young people will get their jobs cut off, play with their boss, and they'll be punished sooner or later.","The statement predicts a negative outcome ('will get their jobs cut off' and 'they'll be punished sooner or later') without solid evidence, based solely on speculation about future events. This involves assuming a negative future indiscriminately, which aligns with Fortune-telling, a cognitive distortion characterized by predicting negative outcomes prematurely.",Fortune-telling
1602,I've been thinking too much. How could they ignore me?,"""How could they ignore me?""","The phrase ""How could they ignore me?"" suggests the speaker is assuming or believing they know what others are thinking or doing without explicit evidence. This reflects an assumption about others' intentions or thoughts without confirmation. Hence, it fits the distortion where one believes they can 'read minds' of others.",Mind Reading
1603,I don't have any friends anymore. I'm alone.,"""I don't have any friends anymore""; ""I'm alone""","The statement takes a specific situation (possibly a temporary or current feeling of loneliness) and extends it to a broad, absolute conclusion about social relationships in general. The phrase ""I don't have any friends anymore"" implies a total absence of friends, and ""I'm alone"" reinforces this sense of complete isolation. This reflects an overgeneralization, where the individual draws a sweeping negative conclusion based on limited evidence or a current emotional state.",Overgeneralization
1604,"I've been surrounded all day, but I'm still lonely, and all I've ever had was a lesson.","I've been surrounded all day, but I'm still lonely, and all I've ever had was a lesson.","The statement reflects a feeling of loneliness despite being physically surrounded by others, which indicates emotional reasoning—concluding one's emotional state (loneliness) as an absolute reality (being lonely despite company). Additionally, 'all I've ever had was a lesson' suggests a negative and broad conclusion drawn from past experiences, indicative of overgeneralization. However, the primary emphasis is on interpreting feelings as facts ('I'm still lonely'), which fits emotional reasoning more directly.",Emotional Reasoning
1605,"My family wanted me to learn better about the future, but I couldn't. I was a sinner to them.","""My family wanted me to learn better about the future"", ""I couldn't"", ""I was a sinner to them""","The statement shows that the person interprets their family's expectation and their own perceived failure as being labeled a 'sinner'. This indicates the person assumes they have been given a negative and global label by their family based on this one aspect. This fits the definition of Labeling, where an individual attaches a negative and fixed label to themselves rather than describing the behavior or situation objectively.",Labeling
1606,I must have let my parents down. They'll never think of me as their baby again.,"""I must have let my parents down"", ""They'll never think of me as their baby again""","The first phrase, ""I must have let my parents down,"" implies a self-judgment with an implicit 'should' or expectation. The second phrase, ""They'll never think of me as their baby again,"" is a prediction about others' future thoughts or feelings without evidence, assuming a negative and permanent outcome. This represents Fortune-telling, as it involves predicting a negative future without concrete proof.",Fortune-telling
1607,My life will fail like a campaign.,"""My life will fail like a campaign.""","The statement predicts a negative outcome about the entire life based on the failure of a campaign. It assumes certainty about the future (that life will fail) without evidence, projecting a negative event forward. This aligns with Fortune-telling, where a person predicts an unfavorable future outcome with certainty.",Fortune-telling
1608,I can't even control my own face. I can't help it.,"""I can't even control my own face. I can't help it.""","The statement expresses a perceived lack of control over a personal aspect (the face), implying helplessness. It reflects the belief that the speaker is unable to influence their own behavior or physical reactions. This aligns with the distortion of being overly self-focused and taking responsibility for something that might be involuntary or out of their control. However, the statement does not suggest all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or fortune-telling. Instead, it shows an exaggerated sense of personal responsibility and a negative interpretation of the self in terms of control, which is best classified as Personalization.",Personalization
1609,He just wanted me to give him good grades. I wasn't his own.,"""He just wanted me to give him good grades."" ""I wasn't his own.""","The speaker assumes they know the other person's exact intention without direct evidence, believing 'He just wanted me to give him good grades.' This indicates an assumption about someone else's thoughts or motives, representing 'Mind Reading.' The second phrase 'I wasn't his own' reflects a sense of exclusion or distancing but doesn't indicate a separate distortion here. The key distortion is the assumption of intent without verification.",Mind Reading
1610,"I can argue with my best friend. When I can change my temper, I'm a bad temper. I'm a bad temper.","""I'm a bad temper.""","The statement ""I'm a bad temper"" indicates the speaker is assigning a global, negative label to themselves based on their difficulty in controlling their temper when arguing with a best friend. This is not merely criticizing a behavior or specific instance but defining their entire identity with a negative term. This fits the cognitive distortion known as Labeling, where a person assigns a fixed, negative label to themselves based on a particular event or trait.",Labeling

They conclude it is a 'hard and fruitless thing' and decide 'I won't do it again.' This indicates a global negative judgment based on a single event and a resolution not to try again. This fits the pattern of Overgeneralization, where one negative experience leads to a broad conclusion about all similar efforts in the future.",Overgeneralization
1613,You saw me here and this truck splattered me. He did it on purpose.,"""He did it on purpose.""","The statement assumes the truck driver intentionally caused harm without definitive evidence, which reflects attributing specific malicious intent to someone else's actions based on personal interpretation.",Mind Reading
1614,I'm born to be stupid. I can't learn anything. I can't learn anything.,"""I'm born to be stupid"", ""I can't learn anything""","The statement ""I'm born to be stupid"" is a global negative label applied to oneself, implying a fixed and unchangeable negative trait. The repetition of ""I can't learn anything"" generalizes an inability across all learning contexts without exception. This reflects the distortion known as labeling, where a broad negative identity is assigned based on perceived faults. Additionally, it can be seen as overgeneralization because of the sweeping statement about the inability to learn anything, but the primary and more fitting distortion is labeling due to the emphasis on an inherent negative self-identity.",Labeling

That's the way it is.,"""I'm sure he thinks I'm a bully,"" ""I'm being rejected by any of his friends,"" ""That's the way it is.""","The speaker assumes they know exactly what another person is thinking ('he thinks I'm a bully') without any concrete evidence, which corresponds to the distortion of mind reading. They also interpret rejection by his friends as confirmation of this assumed belief, solidifying their conclusion. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing categorization, emotional reasoning as the main distortion, nor is the thought expressed as a generalization beyond the social situation. This fits best with mind reading.",Mind Reading
1616,"My dad's gonna say bad things to Mom, and Mom's not gonna love me anymore.","""My dad's gonna say bad things to Mom"", ""Mom's not gonna love me anymore""","The statement predicts a negative future event (dad saying bad things) and a consequent negative outcome (mom not loving me anymore) without evidence, assuming the future with certainty. This reflects a prediction about future events and their emotional impact, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling'. It is not simply mind reading because it involves anticipating future events, nor is it emotional reasoning since the conclusion is based on an assumed future statement rather than current feelings.",Fortune-telling
1617,I'm alone in the dorm. They won't call me. I'll die alone in the dorm.,"""I'm alone in the dorm"", ""They won't call me"", ""I'll die alone in the dorm""","The speaker makes a negative prediction about the future ('They won't call me', 'I'll die alone in the dorm') based on the current situation of being alone. This reflects an assumption that events will unfold in a specific, negative way without evidence, which aligns with 'fortune-telling'. The speaker projects an inevitable outcome without considering other possibilities.",Fortune-telling
1618,I can't even walk down the stairs and break my leg. I'm such a loser.,"""I can't even walk down the stairs and break my leg."" and ""I'm such a loser.""","The first phrase expresses an exaggerated negative view of a specific incident (breaking a leg) and the inability to do a simple task (walking down the stairs). The second phrase labels oneself negatively based on the incident. The statement takes a single event and generalizes it to a global self-label, which is characteristic of 'Labeling'. It is not just overgeneralizing an event but directly assigning a negative identity to oneself.",Labeling
1619,They don't put their feelings on me anymore after they've met. We'll get away.,"""They don't put their feelings on me anymore after they've met. We'll get away.""","The statement implies the speaker assumes they know exactly what others think or feel without direct evidence ('They don't put their feelings on me anymore'). This assumes a specific mindset or attitude of others based on limited information. Additionally, 'We'll get away' indicates a prediction about the future outcome based on this assumption. Hence, the speaker is engaging in 'Mind Reading' by presuming knowledge of others' feelings and possibly 'Fortune-telling' by predicting the future success of getting away. However, the primary distortion is the assumption about others' feelings without concrete evidence, which best fits Mind Reading.",Mind Reading
1620,A lot of parents like to compare. Just get used to it.,"""A lot of parents like to compare"", ""Just get used to it.""","The statement makes a broad generalization about 'a lot of parents' engaging in comparing and then suggests acceptance by saying 'just get used to it.' The use of 'a lot' implies a frequency or pattern that might extend to most or all parents, which points to a generalization beyond a specific case. This fits the cognitive distortion of Overgeneralization, where a single or few instances are generalized to a wide group or always happening. The statement does not reflect the other distortions such as All-or-Nothing Thinking (extremes), Emotional Reasoning (feelings as facts), Fortune-telling (predicting future), Labeling (placing a negative label on self or others), Magnification (exaggeration of negatives), Mental filter (focusing only on negatives), Mind Reading (assuming others’ thoughts), Personalization (self-blame), or Should statements (imposing rules).",Overgeneralization

""I'll never catch up with anyone else.""","The phrase ""There's nothing I can do about it"" reflects a sense of helplessness, but more importantly, the phrase ""I'll never catch up with anyone else"" predicts a future event negatively with certainty. This statement assumes that no matter what, the speaker will fail to improve or succeed compared to others. This is a classic example of Fortune-telling, where the person predicts negative outcomes without evidence.",Fortune-telling

1625,"It is also difficult to accomplish one task, and the future is filled with despair for me.","difficult to accomplish one task, the future is filled with despair for me","The statement highlights difficulty in a single task and then generalizes this to a bleak outlook on the entire future, indicating an exaggerated negative conclusion beyond the present moment. This shows a pattern of drawing broad negative conclusions from a specific event, which aligns with overgeneralization rather than absolute thinking or emotional reasoning. There is no indication of demanding perfection (all-or-nothing), interpreting reality based on emotions alone (emotional reasoning), assuming knowledge of future events beyond evidence (fortune-telling is close, but the statement expresses despair rather than a definitive prediction), or attributing negative intent or thoughts to others (mind reading).",Overgeneralization

The second phrase, ""the rest of my classmates must have laughed at me,"" implies assuming knowledge of others' thoughts or feelings without evidence, i.e., presuming what others think. This corresponds to ""Mind Reading."" Since the task requires choosing only one cognitive distortion, the most dominant distortion is the assumption about what the classmates think, which is classic Mind Reading.",Mind Reading

""There's no point in life like this"" generalizes a current negative feeling to the entire meaning of life, implying a universal and permanent state. ""It's dark"" metaphorically summarizes a bleak outlook on existence. Together, these indicate a broad, sweeping negative generalization based on limited facts or circumstances. This fits the definition of Overgeneralization, where a single or few negative events lead to a conclusion that applies to life as a whole.",Overgeneralization

The first two phrases express a feeling of incapacity or inability ('I can't do anything fast', 'I can't stop others from getting married before me'), which could suggest overgeneralization or personalization; however, the key phrase is the last one: 'I should tell my parents what I think'. The use of 'should' here indicates a demand or rule the speaker believes must be followed, which reflects the 'Should statements' cognitive distortion. The presence of 'should' reveals rigid expectations about behavior. Therefore, the most fitting label is 'Should statements'.",Should statements

It also reflects feelings of invisibility ('people around me don't see me') and suffering.

However, the speaker also rationalizes the ignoring due to parents being busy, showing some realistic reasoning. The key distortion is the belief that simply expressing feelings will definitely change parents' behavior, which is a prediction about the future outcome without certainty—this aligns with 'fortune-telling.'

The sentiment that ""parents have endless love, but it's wrong"" and ""the good things are wasted"" reflects a negative judgment on a situation without nuance. This seems to reflect the cognitive distortion where one draws a general conclusion about an entire group or situation based on a few instances or feelings.

1644,"No matter what happens, I'm a piece of shit.","""No matter what happens"", ""I'm a piece of shit""","The statement contains a universal negative judgment about oneself that applies regardless of any specific situation or context ('No matter what happens'). This indicates a rigid, absolute negative self-assessment that does not allow for any shades of gray or exceptions. The phrase 'I'm a piece of shit' is a broad negative label attributed to oneself. The key is the absolute nature ('No matter what happens') combined with negative self-labeling. This aligns most closely with 'Labeling', where a person assigns a fixed negative label to themselves. It is not simply negative thinking but involves categorizing oneself in a definitive negative way. 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' involves seeing things in black-or-white terms but typically about outcomes or behaviors. Here, the main distortion is applying a harsh negative label regardless of circumstances.",Labeling

However, the belief that this directly makes the exam bad and the act of 'asking him to make his exam a bad one' suggests taking undue responsibility and personal blame for the negative outcome.

""Don't let him get more angry.""","The statement 'It's not right if you don't come home at night' implies a rigid rule about behavior, suggesting something should or should not happen. The phrases also imply concern about causing anger in the father if the rule is broken, which reflects the use of 'should' or 'must' statements to regulate behavior based on expectations.

Then they dismiss the importance of making friends, indicating a decision that not making friends is irrelevant or acceptable. This reflects a way of thinking that filters out the potential negative impact or disappointment of not making friends, focusing only on the hobby aspect. There's no clear evidence of catastrophic thinking, labeling, or jumping to conclusions about social outcomes. Instead, the speaker is applying a filter by ignoring the negative aspect (not making friends) and emphasizing the positive (hobby engagement). Thus, the distortion relates to Mental filter, where certain aspects are unreasonably discounted.",Mental filter

The latter part, 'suddenly he understands why people like to watch TV', suggests a realization or internal reasoning about people’s behavior which seems linked to the first phrase. The key distortion here is the assumption of personal involvement ('something to do with it'), which fits the definition of Personalization — attributing external events to oneself without sufficient evidence or reasoning.",Personalization
1668,"All I have to do is go out there and feel the whispers of people around me, who must be laughing at my fat body, and I'm ashamed to lower my head.","feel the whispers of people around me, who must be laughing at my fat body","The statement involves assuming what others are thinking without any clear evidence ('people around me, who must be laughing').

However, the speaker immediately balances this with a personal commitment to self-improvement, showing no extreme or all-encompassing negativity. There is no evidence of thinking in absolutes (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future negatively (Fortune-telling), or assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading). The phrase 'It is a pity that there are people out there' reflects a judgment, but since it does not label a person or group with a fixed derogatory term, it is not Labeling either. The statement does not rely purely on emotions as evidence (Emotional Reasoning), nor does it selectively focus on negative detail to the exclusion of positives (Mental filter). It reflects awareness and acceptance rather than distortion. Therefore, no cognitive distortion is clearly present.",No Distortion
1671,Perhaps it was my mistake to introduce myself into the vortex of tragedy and to try to escape the reality at this point.,my mistake to introduce myself into the vortex of tragedy and to try to escape the reality at this point,"The statement reflects self-blame by referring to the action as a 'mistake,' indicating a tendency to take personal responsibility for events that may not be wholly under one's control. The phrase 'vortex of tragedy' metaphorically magnifies the negative situation, but the core distortion lies in blaming oneself for being involved or attempting to escape reality. This aligns with the personalization distortion, where the individual attributes responsibility or fault to themselves in situations where this may not be warranted.",Personalization

This suggests making a broad future prediction based on the current outcome. However, the statement does not indicate an absolute negative evaluation (ruling out all-or-nothing thinking), does not overemphasize emotions, nor does it involve labeling or mind reading. The key cognitive distortion is the prediction about future outcomes ('next time I will...'), which aligns with 'Fortune-telling' — assuming certainty about future events without sufficient evidence.",Fortune-telling

To discourage my motivation, let me say that performance evaluation is best not to exist.","""To discourage my motivation, let me say that performance evaluation is best not to exist.""","The statement implies a belief that because motivation is discouraged, performance evaluations should not exist at all. This suggests an extreme or absolute view, disregarding any middle ground or nuance. It reflects an 'all or nothing' approach—either performance evaluation does not exist or it completely ruins motivation.

The speaker also mentions suffering from this situation daily, indicating an emotional experience tied directly to the belief. The key cognitive distortion here is 'Fortune-telling' because the speaker predicts a negative outcome (that fellow students will not listen) as a certainty, influencing their decision to resign. The other distortions like Mind Reading (assuming others' thoughts) or Emotional Reasoning (assuming the negative feeling equals reality) are less fitting because the emphasis is on predicting a future event rather than interpreting others' thoughts or emotions.

The person interprets their distress upon waking in the night as an extreme, catastrophic event. This is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as proof of reality without factual basis, rather than a balanced or logical interpretation.",Emotional Reasoning
1677,"The world only cares about beautiful people: I was born ugly, I was born ugly, and I'm never gonna get any more beautiful.","""The world only cares about beautiful people"", ""I was born ugly"", ""I'm never gonna get any more beautiful""","The statement begins with a sweeping generalization about the world only caring about beautiful people, implying an absolute and universal truth. The phrases ""I was born ugly"" and ""I'm never gonna get any more beautiful"" suggest a fixed, unchangeable identity. This reflects a pattern where one negative experience or belief is overextended to all situations without exceptions, characteristic of Overgeneralization. The belief that the speaker will never become more beautiful also reflects a future negative prediction, but this is closely tied to the overgeneralized belief of being born ugly and the world’s attitudes. No other distortion such as Labeling (which would be just name-calling), Emotional Reasoning (which would rely on feelings as proof), or Fortune-telling (specific prediction with certainty about the future) fits as precisely as Overgeneralization here.",Overgeneralization
1678,Kids don't know where they are. It's disgusting.,Kids don't know where they are. It's disgusting.,"The statement assumes that 'kids don't know where they are,' which is a generalized conclusion about all kids without specific evidence, indicating an overgeneralization. Furthermore, the term 'It's disgusting' reflects a negative evaluation linked to the assumed ignorance. The key distortion lies in the broad negative assumption about all kids' awareness, rather than a specific instance or evidence. This aligns most closely with Overgeneralization, where a broad conclusion is drawn from limited information.",Overgeneralization

I'm sorry I didn't have friends.,"""Why can't I make friends?"" and ""I'm sorry I didn't have friends.""","The statement begins with a question implying a negative expectation about future social success, suggesting a prediction of failure without evidence. This reflects an assumption about the future, characteristic of fortune-telling. Additionally, the second part expresses regret and a negative conclusion about past social experiences. However, the main cognitive distortion is in the foresight about not being able to make friends, which is an unfounded negative prediction about future events.",Fortune-telling
1680,"I'm a bad person, and stealing is just my destiny, and I'm used to it.","""I'm a bad person"", ""stealing is just my destiny"", ""I'm used to it""","The phrase ""I'm a bad person"" is a direct negative self-label, which generalizes the person's entire identity based on their actions or feelings. ""Stealing is just my destiny"" implies a fixed negative outcome that the person believes they are bound to, but the main distortion still lies in assigning a negative label to oneself rather than just predicting the future. Thus, the key cognitive distortion here is 'Labeling,' as the person is negatively categorizing themselves.",Labeling

She's never gonna be happy with me.,"""Grandma's never gonna like me."", ""She's never gonna be happy with me.""","The statement predicts a definite negative outcome about Grandma's feelings without evidence, assuming foreknowledge of future events and emotions.

1682,I can't feel a thing. No one cares about me. Let's just go down like this.,I can't feel a thing. No one cares about me. Let's just go down like this.,"The statement 'No one cares about me' represents an assumption without concrete evidence, reflecting a belief about other people's thoughts or feelings. This is indicative of mind reading, where one assumes they know what others think (e.g., that nobody cares). The phrases 'I can't feel a thing' and 'Let's just go down like this' show emotional pain and hopelessness but do not indicate other distortions such as all-or-nothing or fortune-telling as prominently as mind reading does here.",Mind Reading

This pattern takes one negative experience and applies it universally to all friendships, which is characteristic of overgeneralization. The statement does not reflect a black-and-white mindset (All-or-Nothing), predict a certain future without evidence (Fortune-telling), nor does it involve interpreting others' thoughts (Mind Reading). Therefore, the distortion is best identified as Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
1685,The boss couldn't have noticed anything. He must have closed his eyes to his colleagues.,"""The boss couldn't have noticed anything.""

However, since they attribute the situation's difficulty exclusively to themselves feeling pressure, and implicitly blame themselves or feel uniquely burdened, this leans more toward Personalization. The second phrase ""It's gonna be tough in the company"" is a prediction about the future based on feelings rather than facts, which fits Fortune-telling. Between these, the stronger distortion is the personalization of pressure. However, the phrase indicates a future negative outcome without certainty, which is Fortune-telling. Because the statement explicitly predicts a tough future (""It's gonna be tough in the company"") without evidence, the primary distortion is Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

1689,I don't know yet. I'll wait for the results.,"""I don't know yet"", ""I'll wait for the results""","The statement reflects a neutral and realistic approach to uncertainty by acknowledging the lack of current knowledge and choosing to wait for more information before making a judgment. There is no evidence of expecting a negative or positive outcome without evidence (fortune-telling), no extreme thinking (all-or-nothing), no emotional justification, or any of the other listed distortions.

Finally, it applies a harsh negative label to the self ('I'm a piece of shit'). This shows a broad generalization from a specific situation ('can't learn a car') to a universal belief ('I can't learn'), which defines the distortion as Overgeneralization. Additionally, the phrase 'I'm a piece of shit' is an example of Labeling, but since the overgeneralization leads directly to the negative label, the core distortion underlying the statement is Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
1692,"Everyone's thoughts are different, just to clarify the misunderstandings, because our way of thinking is unique.",Everyone's thoughts are different; our way of thinking is unique.,"The statement highlights the idea that each individual's thoughts differ and that misunderstandings arise because thinking is unique to each person.

The phrase ""He's not easy to talk about"" suggests an assumption about the person's communicability without confirmation. This indicates the person is making assumptions about someone else's intentions and future actions, which aligns with the cognitive distortion of predicting negative outcomes without factual basis. Moreover, the use of ""probably"" signals guessing rather than knowing. Therefore, this fits most closely with the cognitive distortion called ""Fortune-telling.""",Fortune-telling
1700,If only I could get sick for my parents. If only I could die for my parents.,"""If only I could get sick for my parents. If only I could die for my parents.""","The statement expresses a desire to sacrifice oneself physically (getting sick or dying) for the sake of the parents. This indicates a form of personalization, as the speaker takes responsibility for the well-being or protection of their parents in an exaggerated, self-blaming manner. The speaker is attributing a personal obligation or burden that is likely unrealistic and self-imposed. There is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or other distortions that focus on predictions or absolutes. Emotional reasoning is less fitting because the statement is about a hypothetical wish rather than reasoning based purely on feelings. The focus on self-sacrifice aligns best with personalization.",Personalization
1701,It's broken. The clothes are backwards. It's embarrassing.,"""It's broken."" ""The clothes are backwards."" ""It's embarrassing.""","The statement focuses on the negative aspects without considering any neutral or positive possibilities, emphasizing that the situation is 'broken' and 'embarrassing.' The use of 'embarrassing' indicates the speaker is basing their judgment on their emotional response rather than objective evidence. This suggests the distortion is based on emotions dictating reality, typical of Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
1702,"They won't believe I'm depressed, my family will think I'm pretending, or everyone will feel depressed sometimes.","They won't believe I'm depressed, my family will think I'm pretending, or everyone will feel depressed sometimes.","The speaker is assuming that others (family, others) have negative thoughts or beliefs about their depression without any evidence. They predict how others will perceive their situation, which involves making assumptions about others' thoughts and feelings. This matches the distortion where one believes they can know what others are thinking without confirmation.",Mind Reading
1703,Dad should be so angry because of what I'm not doing. I have to find out what's wrong so he doesn't get angry.,"""Dad should be so angry"", ""I have to find out what's wrong so he doesn't get angry""","The phrase ""Dad should be so angry"" reflects the use of 'should' or 'must' statements, imposing rigid expectations about how dad is supposed to feel. Additionally, ""I have to find out what's wrong so he doesn't get angry"" implies the speaker believes it is their responsibility to prevent dad's anger, but this is secondary to the primary distortion. The main cognitive distortion here is the use of 'should' statements, which often create pressure and guilt by dictating how others or situations 'must' be.",Should statements
1704,It doesn't make sense. It doesn't solve the problem.,It doesn't make sense. It doesn't solve the problem.,"The statement expresses a rigid evaluation that the solution either makes sense or does not, and either solves the problem or does not, with no middle ground or consideration for partial success or partial understanding. This dichotomous thinking pattern where outcomes are seen in absolute terms reflects the 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' distortion. There is no emotional justification or prediction about the future, ruling out Emotional Reasoning and Fortune-telling. The statement is not assigning a negative trait to a person, so Labeling is excluded. It is not focusing exclusively on negative details (Mental filter), nor assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading). It also does not generalize beyond this instance, personalize blame, or use 'Should statements.' Thus, the closest and most fitting cognitive distortion is All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1705,He won't help me in vain. He secretly expects me to return it.,"""He won't help me in vain."" and ""He secretly expects me to return it.""","The statement assumes the other person's motives without any direct evidence, attributing hidden expectations to him. This reflects a belief about what another person thinks or feels without confirmation. This kind of assumption about another person's thoughts or intentions aligns with 'Mind Reading'. No indication of other distortions such as all-or-nothing thinking or emotional reasoning is present.",Mind Reading
1706,"During this period, I felt like I had lost control of my world and everything seemed confusing.",I felt like I had lost control of my world and everything seemed confusing,"The speaker is basing their perception of reality on their emotional state ('I felt like...'), concluding that they have lost control and that everything is confusing.

1707,"I was so angry to roll out of the window and yelled at him, but I was upset that I was unable to control my own behaviour, thinking that I was low self-control and that I was a waste that could not control my emotions.",thinking that I was low self-control and that I was a waste that could not control my emotions,"The person interprets a moment of losing control as a definitive and global negative self-assessment ('a waste'), indicating an extreme and absolute evaluation of themselves. This reflects an all-or-nothing evaluative style where behavior is seen in black-and-white terms, without nuance or exceptions.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1708,I don't want to do it anyway. I'm not doing it anyway. I'm not doing it anyway.,"""I'm not doing it anyway"" repeated three times, and the phrase ""I don't want to do it anyway.""","The repetition of ""I'm not doing it anyway"" suggests a rigid, black-and-white mindset, indicating a refusal without considering any nuances or possibilities for change. The phrase ""I don't want to do it anyway"" further emphasizes a definitive decision that is absolute and unchangeable. This kind of absolutist thinking aligns closely with All-or-Nothing Thinking, where things are viewed in extremes (either fully doing it or not at all) without middle ground or flexibility.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1709,I'm happy to do the chores myself. It's nice to work sometimes.,"""I'm happy to do the chores myself."" ""It's nice to work sometimes.""","The speaker expresses a positive attitude towards doing chores and working sometimes.

1710,Looks like I'm still a little short on this part of my knowledge.,I'm still a little short on this part of my knowledge,"The statement acknowledges a deficiency in knowledge without making an extreme judgment or generalization. It does not involve interpreting emotions as facts (Emotional Reasoning), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), assigning negative global labels (Labeling), orFiltering out positives (Mental filter). Instead, it reflects a realistic self-assessment without using absolute terms, personal blame, or should statements. Therefore, it aligns with no typical cognitive distortion but rather a balanced acknowledgment of a knowledge gap.",No Distortion
1711,"That is not what I am good at, and there is no need to dwell on it, to devote more energy to the areas of interest to which I aspire.",That is not what I am good at; no need to dwell on it; devote more energy to areas of interest,"The statement recognizes a personal limitation ('not what I am good at') without exaggeration or absolute negative labeling. It also reflects a conscious choice to focus on more positive, aspirational areas. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or other distortions such as fortune-telling or labeling. Rather, the speaker is realistically acknowledging a weakness and choosing to prioritize strengths and interests. This indicates a balanced and adaptive thought pattern, thus no cognitive distortion is detected.",No Distortion

He's had a bad time, and he's trying to mess with me.","""He must've had a bad job recently"", ""He's had a bad time"", ""he's trying to mess with me""","The statement involves assuming the thoughts, motives, or intentions of another person without evidence — specifically, it asserts that the person is intentionally trying to mess with the speaker. This reflects 'Mind Reading' because the speaker is concluding what someone else is thinking or intending. It is not emotional reasoning because it is not based solely on feelings; it is not fortune-telling as it is about a current assumption, not predicting the future; it is not all-or-nothing, labeling, magnification, mental filter, personalization, or should statements because none represent fitting characteristics here.",Mind Reading
1713,"Whether I'm studying or working, it's hard to choose, it's hard to figure out.","Whether I'm studying or working, it's hard to choose, it's hard to figure out.","The statement reflects difficulty in making a choice and figuring things out in both studied scenarios (studying or working). This indicates a focus on a negative or challenging aspect without presenting an all-encompassing or absolute view (not all-or-nothing), nor jumping to conclusions about the future (not fortune-telling). The speaker is emphasizing difficulty but does not assign a negative label to themselves or others (no labeling), nor are they reading others' thoughts or engaging in emotional reasoning. The phrase is about personal struggle with decision-making, which points to a magnification of the difficulty or problem, as 'it's hard' is highlighted twice. This suggests the person is emphasizing the challenge beyond a neutral assessment, matching the magnification distortion.",Magnification
1714,"I worshiped myself, and I was responsible for the failure of the project, and I hurt my family, and I was a sinner.","I worshiped myself, I was responsible for the failure of the project, I hurt my family, I was a sinner","The sentence links the self-judgment (worshiping oneself) with attributing responsibility for multiple negative outcomes (project failure, hurting family) to oneself, ending with labeling oneself as a sinner. This reflects a tendency to assign broad, negative personal blame for various events and to define oneself in a negative way. The inclusion of 'I was a sinner' is a clear example of labeling oneself negatively. Therefore, the key distortion is 'Labeling', where complex experiences and actions are reduced to a negative global label about the self.",Labeling

This extends a single negative event or interaction into a permanent and pervasive condition. The speaker is seeing the scenario in absolute terms and expecting it to characterize all future experience. This indicates a pattern of thinking where one negative event leads to a broad, sweeping conclusion. This aligns most closely with Overgeneralization, where one assumes one event or example applies universally and permanently.",Overgeneralization

They speculate about the other's internal state or intentions, which reflects an attempt to 'read the mind' of another person. This fits the cognitive distortion called Mind Reading because it involves assuming one understands someone else's thoughts or feelings inaccurately.",Mind Reading
1717,"Every time I walk down the street, I feel like I'm being laughed at.","Every time I walk down the street, I feel like I'm being laughed at.","The phrase 'I feel like I'm being laughed at' indicates a belief about what others are thinking without concrete evidence. The person assumes others are laughing at them, which involves assuming knowledge of others' thoughts or intentions. This aligns closely with 'Mind Reading,' where an individual believes they understand others' thoughts or feelings without factual support. While there is a feeling involved, the distortion centers on inferring others' thoughts rather than basing the feeling solely on emotion (which would be Emotional Reasoning). The statement does not generalize beyond the specific context or involve absolute terms.",Mind Reading
1718,"The clothes are soaked, it's embarrassing to meet someone you know, so I'd like to find a place to sew in.","The clothes are soaked, it's embarrassing to meet someone you know","The statement suggests that because the clothes are soaked, the person feels embarrassed about meeting someone familiar. This feeling is based on an emotional response ('it's embarrassing') rather than an objective fact. The conclusion about embarrassment is drawn from the person's feelings, indicating emotional reasoning rather than logical evaluation of the situation.",Emotional Reasoning

This reflects the individual taking personal responsibility unnecessarily for something that may not be fully under their control. The phrase 'if it were not for my fault' indicates a self-blame pattern characteristic of Personalization, where one assumes blame for events beyond their control.",Personalization

This indicates overgeneralization, where a single or few difficulties are expanded to an absolute failure in all areas. 'I don't know what to do' and 'It doesn't make sense' reflect confusion but do not necessarily point to other distortions like emotional reasoning or labeling. The primary distortion is identified by the extreme global negative assessment about handling 'anything', consistent with overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
1722,"Learn more, learn more about the character and abilities of the members, and you'll be able to organize us all.","Learn more, learn more about the character and abilities of the members, and you'll be able to organize us all.","The statement suggests that by gaining more knowledge about the team members, the speaker will definitely be able to organize them all. This implies a certainty about a future outcome based on an action (learning more), which fits the pattern of predicting a future result confidently. There is no indication of extreme black-and-white thinking, emotional justification, or labeling of individuals here. It does not generalize beyond the context or assign blame improperly. The core cognitive feature is the prediction of a future event ('you'll be able to organize us all') as a definite consequence of the action ('learn more').",Fortune-telling

I can no longer believe that efforts will be rewarded.,"""It's all for nothing."", ""I can't see any gains."", ""I can no longer believe that efforts will be rewarded.""","The speaker discounts any positive outcome or progress by stating that efforts yield no results and will not be rewarded. This involves a negative conclusion about current and future situations without concrete evidence. The belief that efforts will never be rewarded suggests a negative prediction about the future, fitting the pattern of predicting bad outcomes without certainty. This aligns with Fortune-telling, where one assumes negative future outcomes without sufficient basis rather than seeing the situation realistically or open-mindedly.",Fortune-telling
1724,I'm so sleepy. I'm not sure if I'll get scolded by my boss tomorrow.,"""I'm not sure if I'll get scolded by my boss tomorrow""","The statement involves predicting a negative outcome (being scolded by the boss) without having evidence or certainty. This reflects assuming what will happen in the future based on worry rather than facts, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling'. There is no indication of assuming others' thoughts ('Mind Reading'), nor is there an extreme either/or thinking ('All-or-Nothing'), nor self-blame ('Personalization'). The focus is on predicting a negative event, hence 'Fortune-telling' fits best.",Fortune-telling

This reflects an all-or-nothing perspective. Additionally, ""It's probably the worst job on Earth"" is an exaggerated, global negative evaluation, indicating magnification. However, the predominant distortion is the absolute, black-and-white thinking about life and hope, which is characteristic of all-or-nothing thinking. The phrase ""It's probably the worst job on Earth"" also shows a predictive negative expectation, but the strongest distortion is the rigid categorical judgment.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1726,I'm a complete piece of shit. I can't do a good dissertation.,"""I'm a complete piece of shit"" and ""I can't do a good dissertation""","The statement contains a global negative label toward the self ('complete piece of shit'), which is an extreme and negative assignment of identity. Additionally, the phrase 'I can't do a good dissertation' expresses a sweeping judgment of personal ability based on current feelings or outcomes. This matches the definition of 'Labeling,' where one assigns oneself a negative and absolute label, rather than focusing on specific behaviors or facts. While there is an element of overgeneralization, the prevailing distortion is the self-labeling that the person has applied.",Labeling

This reflects interpreting the day's overall quality based solely on negative events or feelings, without considering any neutral or positive aspects. The statement 'It's a bad day!' generalizes the negative experience beyond specific instances. This fits the pattern of Overgeneralization, where a single or limited negative incident leads to a broad, sweeping negative conclusion.",Overgeneralization
1728,I don't understand what it means to get married and have children. Is that all they see in life?,"""I don't understand what it means to get married and have children."" and ""Is that all they see in life?""","The speaker is making a broad assumption about people who get married and have children, implying that this is the entirety of their life perspective. This generalization extends one view or experience to an entire group without sufficient evidence. The phrase ""Is that all they see in life?"" suggests the belief that these people have no other goals or values, indicating overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

My world, like a broken glass, has brutally cut me.","""No matter what I do, I can't succeed."" and ""My world, like a broken glass, has brutally cut me.""","The phrase ""No matter what I do, I can't succeed"" indicates a belief that failure is inevitable in all situations, signifying a sweeping conclusion based on limited evidence — this fits the pattern of Overgeneralization. The metaphor ""My world, like a broken glass, has brutally cut me"" amplifies the sense of pain and failure, but the core distortion lies in the absolutist belief about continual failure regardless of effort. Other distortions such as All-or-Nothing Thinking might seem close, but this statement emphasizes a broad, generalized conclusion about enduring failure rather than a strict black-and-white view. Emotional Reasoning is present to some extent, but the dominant distortion is the overgeneralized negative conclusion.",Overgeneralization
1730,"Too careless, there is a need to be more vigilant recently.","""Too careless"", ""there is a need to be more vigilant recently""","The statement identifies the speaker as ""too careless,"" which is a negative label directed at oneself. This suggests a broad, global judgment rather than a specific behavior. The phrase ""need to be more vigilant recently"" implies a self-directed expectation or demand on behavior. Although there is a judgment and expectation involved, the central cognitive distortion is the labeling of the self as ""too careless,"" which is an example of applying a generalized negative label rather than focusing on specific actions.",Labeling
1731,"Their tall ones envied me, but I should also envied them. No one is perfect, no one is useless.","""I should also envied them""; ""No one is perfect, no one is useless.""","The phrase ""I should also envied them"" implies a prescriptive view about how the speaker believes they must feel or act, which aligns with the cognitive distortion called 'Should statements.' This distortion involves imposing rigid rules or expectations on oneself or others, often leading to guilt or frustration. The statement ""No one is perfect, no one is useless"" is more of a balanced acknowledgment and does not reflect distortion. The key distorted element is the internal demand expressed by ""I should also envied them.""",Should statements

However, they also acknowledge that their feeling or assumption has been proven wrong repeatedly ('every time I think it's the bottom of the valley, it's not'). This indicates the use of emotion as evidence for reality, which is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions here since the statement focuses on interpreting feelings as facts and then questioning them.",Emotional Reasoning
1733,"If my lover betrays me, then what do I mean by living? No one loves me.","If my lover betrays me, then what do I mean by living? No one loves me.","The statement begins with a conditional assumption about being betrayed by a lover leading to the conclusion that life loses meaning, which is an extreme, all-or-nothing perspective on the situation. It then generalizes this perceived betrayal to the belief that no one loves the speaker, extending one event to an overall, definitive judgment about their social/emotional worth. This reflects overgeneralization because it takes one negative event and applies it broadly to life and relationships.",Overgeneralization

Following this, they generalize this failure to a broader negative self-assessment by labeling themselves as a 'failed owner.' This is a classic example of overgeneralizing a single incident to their overall capability and identity. The final phrase 'I don't have to raise any small animals anymore' further implies a sweeping conclusion about their future role based on this one experience. Thus, the statement reflects a pattern of overgeneralization rather than other distortions such as all-or-nothing thinking (which would involve only absolute extremes), labeling alone (which is present but secondary), or emotional reasoning (which would focus on feelings as evidence).",Overgeneralization

These are generalized statements that apply a quality universally to entire groups based on age. This indicates an overgeneralization, as it assumes all young people and all experienced people fit these broad stereotypes without exception. There is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking since the statement does not present an either/or scenario or an absolute judgment about a single outcome. There is no clear emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, labeling, magnification, mental filter, mind reading, personalization, or should statement involved.",Overgeneralization
1736,"I've been watched, my virginity is gone, my life is ruined, my life is ruined.","I've been watched, my virginity is gone, my life is ruined","The statement moves from a single event ('I've been watched' and 'my virginity is gone') to a broad and extreme conclusion about the entire life being ruined. This shows a pattern where a specific negative incident is seen as completely devastating and defining the whole future, which indicates an extreme, all-encompassing evaluation. This type of thinking is characteristic of 'All-or-Nothing Thinking,' where things are seen in black-or-white terms without middle ground.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1737,No one wants to eat with me. I'm a loser.,"""No one wants to eat with me."" and ""I'm a loser.""","The phrase ""No one wants to eat with me"" suggests a broad generalization about all people based on what is likely a limited situation or perception; this indicates overgeneralization. The phrase ""I'm a loser"" applies a global, negative label to oneself rather than describing a specific behavior or event, which aligns with labeling. Since the statement contains both overgeneralization and labeling components, the stronger distortion here is labeling because the self-characterization 'loser' is a prejudiced, definitive negative label affecting self-identity.",Labeling
1738,It's just a mission to go back to Wang Sing and have a good time.,"""It's just a mission to go back to Wang Sing and have a good time.""","The statement expresses a neutral or positive outlook about the mission, framing it as simply an opportunity to go back to a place and enjoy oneself. There is no indication of extreme black-and-white thinking, no negative emotional inference, no anticipation of future negative events, no self or others labeling, no exaggeration or minimization of facts, no selective attention to negatives, no assumption of others' thoughts, no generalization beyond this specific situation, no self-blaming, and no prescriptive 'should' language.

I'm such a dick.,"""I can't teach my own kids""; ""I'm such a dick""","The first phrase ""I can't teach my own kids"" implies a generalization about the speaker's ability based on a specific instance or feeling. The second phrase ""I'm such a dick"" assigns a negative global label to oneself. This shows the cognitive distortion known as Labeling, where one labels oneself in a globally negative way based on limited evidence or emotion.",Labeling
1740,I can't blame my children. I can't help it.,"""I can't blame my children"", ""I can't help it""","The phrase ""I can't blame my children"" suggests the speaker is attributing responsibility away from the children and possibly excusing behavior or situations. The phrase ""I can't help it"" implies a feeling of helplessness or lack of control over the situation. This pattern reflects a cognitive distortion where external factors or uncontrollable circumstances are invoked as justification, which aligns closely with 'Personalization' since the speaker is indirectly taking on responsibility or making excuses about actions or outcomes related to others. However, since the speaker is not blaming themselves but excusing others, and implying lack of control, this matches 'Personalization' less. It is not 'Emotional Reasoning' because no emotion is cited as proof of a fact. It is not 'All-or-Nothing' or 'Fortune-telling' or any other listed distortions directly. The primary distortion here involves an external attribution with a helpless stance, which fits best with 'Personalization' given the focus on responsibility and control related to others' behavior.",Personalization

The phrase 'That's what I always do' shows the speaker is assuming a never-ending pattern from a few instances, which fits the definition of Overgeneralization. Additionally, the harsh self-judgment 'I'm a piece of shit' fits the Labeling distortion. However, the core distortion driving the statement is the overgeneralization of isolated incidents into an absolute, permanent pattern, which leads to the negative self-label.

I want to believe in myself, to work well, not to let the boss down on my new man.","The statement interprets the boss's promotion as a direct reflection or sign of the person's ability, which indicates the person is personalizing the promotion as a validation of their worth or capability. The desire to 'not let the boss down' also suggests taking personal responsibility for the boss's expectations. This reflects the cognitive distortion of Personalization, where one attributes external events to oneself without considering other factors. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or other listed distortions as the focus is on the self-interpretation of the promotion.",Personalization

Additionally, the statement ""if I die, they won't even notice"" implies assuming what others will think or feel without evidence, effectively 'mind reading' others' reactions or emotions.

The speaker generalizes from the parents' fighting, regardless of the actual feelings or other positive parental behaviors, to the conclusion that they are an 'unfortunate child,' that their childhood is 'full of pain,' and that they are 'not happy.'

The term 'definitely a dark spot' emphasizes a negative judgment of this inability, reinforcing an all-or-nothing perspective.

It then predicts a bleak future outcome (being old, sick, poor, and uncared for) as an inevitable consequence, portraying it as absolute truth without considering other possibilities.

""He's always mad at him"" can suggest Overgeneralization, but it supports the global negative label in the first phrase. ""He's only looking for San"" appears to reflect a specific belief or interpretation but does not necessarily indicate a distortion type stronger than Labeling.

The phrase 'I'm also being ridiculed by others' indicates the speaker believes they are being judged negatively, likely without direct evidence. This aligns with 'Mind Reading,' where one assumes knowledge of others' negative thoughts.

This involves assigning a global negative label rather than addressing specific behaviors. Additionally, the statement 'I will never count on them in my life' indicates a sweeping conclusion about the children's dependability, likely based on limited examples or emotional reaction. The key cognitive distortion here is labeling because the speaker is attaching a negative global identity ('ungrateful child') to the children, which oversimplifies and generalizes their character.",Labeling

This reflects a pattern of personalizing an outcome based on an assumed past action that cannot be verified. The person is taking responsibility and personalizing an event in an exaggerated way, as if this single presumed past action is the reason for current outcomes. This fits the 'Personalization' distortion where one assumes excessive responsibility or causality for events.",Personalization

I'm weak.,"""I'm a sick man"", ""I've always had a problem with my body"", ""I can't cure it"", ""I'm weak""","The statement contains self-labeling with negative terms such as ""sick"" and ""weak,"" which generalizes the speaker's identity to a negative, fixed trait rather than describing a situation or behavior. The phrase ""I've always had a problem with my body"" indicates a broad generalization over time. However, the core issue is the negative self-identity term ""I'm a sick man,"" which fits the cognitive distortion known as Labeling, where global negative labels replace a more balanced view of oneself.",Labeling
1804,"I'm so tired, but I can't be responsible for my project, and even if I feel like I've been squeezed, I can't get out of this project that I've been working on for a long time.","""I'm so tired"", ""I can't be responsible for my project"", ""I've been squeezed"", ""I can't get out of this project I've been working on for a long time""","The statement reflects feelings of exhaustion and helplessness, with the speaker expressing a sense of being trapped in a project despite significant discomfort. The phrase ""I can't be responsible for my project"" suggests a belief that they are incapable of handling the responsibility. ""Even if I feel like I've been squeezed"" indicates emotional distress. The key point is the perceived inability to escape the situation, which reflects a negative absolute belief about their capacity to act or change the circumstance. This aligns with 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' because the speaker sees their situation as either completely unmanageable or hopeless, without any middle ground or possibility for partial control or success.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1805,"I'm useless, coward. I don't deserve to sit with my good brothers and sisters.","""I'm useless, coward."" ""I don't deserve to sit with my good brothers and sisters.""","The statement contains harsh negative labels directed at the self, such as 'useless' and 'coward,' which are global, negative evaluations rather than specific assessments of behavior or situation. This fits the definition of 'Labeling,' where a person attaches a negative, often extreme label to themselves. Additionally, the phrase 'I don't deserve to sit with my good brothers and sisters' implies a self-assessment based on this negative labeling. Unlike all-or-nothing thinking, which involves all-encompassing black-and-white judgments, here the emphasis is on assigning a negative identity or label to oneself.",Labeling
1806,They never thought of me. I was like a transparent man floating around the world.,"""They never thought of me.""; ""I was like a transparent man floating around the world.""","The phrase ""They never thought of me"" implies attributing specific thoughts or intentions to others without direct evidence, which aligns with 'Mind Reading.' The speaker assumes others' awareness and neglect without verifying their actual thoughts. The metaphor ""I was like a transparent man"" reflects feeling ignored or invisible, supporting the perception that others are consciously excluding or overlooking them, consistent with 'Mind Reading' rather than other distortions like 'Overgeneralization' or 'Emotional Reasoning.'",Mind Reading

All are selfish, care about themselves, and friendship is a joke.","""I'll never trust anyone"", ""I don't need friends at all"", ""All are selfish"", ""friendship is a joke""","The statement takes a negative experience with some friends and extends that conclusion to everyone, stating a permanent inability to trust anyone and dismissing the concept of friendship entirely. This indicates a broad, sweeping conclusion based on limited evidence. The key phrases generalize one or a few incidents to all people and situations, which is characteristic of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
1808,"I saw my roommate with my water bottle the other day. He drugged me, didn't he?","""I saw my roommate with my water bottle the other day."" and ""He drugged me, didn't he?""","The statement involves assuming that because the roommate was seen with the water bottle, they must have drugged the speaker. This is a conclusion reached without evidence, purely based on a guess about the roommate's intentions or actions. The speaker is attributing malicious intent directly to the roommate's actions without confirmation, effectively 'reading the roommate's mind' and assuming negative behavior. This fits the definition of Mind Reading, where one assumes to know what another person is thinking or intending without concrete evidence.",Mind Reading
1809,"Prince Charming is only in fairy tales, and that's all I can find.","""Prince Charming is only in fairy tales"", ""that's all I can find""","The statement suggests that because Prince Charming appears only in fairy tales and the speaker cannot find any real examples, they conclude that Prince Charming does not exist in reality. This reflects a broad conclusion drawn from limited evidence. The key phrase ""that's all I can find"" indicates the speaker generalizes from a narrow set of data to a universal truth, which is characteristic of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
1810,Please teach your classmates to try harder. I'll be fine.,"""Please teach your classmates to try harder."" and ""I'll be fine.""","The statement implies that the speaker assumes others (classmates) are not trying hard enough and requests intervention, while also asserting that the speaker themselves will be fine regardless. The key phrase 'try harder' indicates a 'should' statement—expressing an expectation about the behavior of others. The speaker is imposing a standard or rule on others' actions, which aligns with 'Should statements' cognitive distortion. There's no evidence of assumptions about feelings (emotional reasoning), predicting the future (fortune-telling), or labeling individuals. The focus is on what others 'should' do.",Should statements
1811,"We have different personalities, so we often have conflicts. I feel very anxious.","""We have different personalities, so we often have conflicts. I feel very anxious.""","The statement acknowledges a factual cause (different personalities) leading to frequent conflicts, which is a realistic appraisal rather than a distortion. However, the phrase ""I feel very anxious"" reflects an emotional state based on the conflicts. The reasoning here is that the speaker uses their emotional response ('I feel very anxious') as evidence that the situation is negative or threatening. This fits the pattern of Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are treated as proof of reality, irrespective of objective facts.",Emotional Reasoning

This aligns with mind reading, where one infers others' thoughts or feelings without sufficient data.",Mind Reading
1813,"I don't look good. I don't need makeup because I'm gonna dye my hair, but you're fucking right. I drew eyebrows.","'I don't look good', 'I don't need makeup because I'm gonna dye my hair', 'you're fucking right', 'I drew eyebrows'","The speaker starts with a negative self-judgment ('I don't look good'), which reflects a negative global evaluation about their appearance. The phrase 'I don't need makeup because I'm gonna dye my hair' indicates a somewhat rational or neutral statement about planned change. However, the phrase 'you're fucking right' suggests agreement with a previous negative judgment, likely reinforcing self-criticism. Finally, 'I drew eyebrows' seems to be a concrete action mentioned without clear positive impact on the overall self-view. The primary distortion is in the negative global labeling of self-worth based on appearance ('I don't look good'), which is an example of 'Labeling'—assigning a negative global label to oneself.",Labeling
1814,I don't need to know that no one likes me. They'll have to stay away from me because I'm ugly.,"""no one likes me"", ""they'll have to stay away from me"", ""I'm ugly""","The statement assumes a universal negative judgment from others ('no one likes me'), which is an overgeneralization from presumably limited or selective experiences. The speaker then attributes others' behavior (staying away) directly to their physical appearance ('because I'm ugly'), which is a self-label emphasizing a negative identity. While there are elements of mind reading ('knowing' others don't like me), the central distortion is focusing on a broad negative generalization about social rejection and self-worth.",Overgeneralization
1815,"It turns out that my recent pain stems from illness, which is unexpected and reasonable.","recent pain stems from illness, unexpected and reasonable","The statement acknowledges the cause of pain as illness, which is a factual explanation.

There is no indication of exaggerated negative thinking, emotional assumptions, or unfounded conclusions about the future or others' thoughts. The sentence reflects a realistic appraisal without cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
1816,"The purpose of the diet is to make yourself healthier, not to calculate the calorie intake of each food.","The purpose of the diet is to make yourself healthier, not to calculate the calorie intake of each food.","The statement emphasizes what the diet's purpose should be—focusing on health improvement rather than calorie counting. It prescribes a specific way of thinking or behaving regarding dieting, implying an expectation of how one ought to approach the diet. This aligns with 'Should statements,' where the speaker imposes a rigid rule or standard ('should' focus on health rather than calorie counting). There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or other distortions in this sentence.",Should statements

What such a man does alive is a waste of social resources!,"""It's disgusting!"", ""I'm so angry!"", ""A man like this ruins his mother's heart!"", ""What such a man does alive is a waste of social resources!""","The speaker makes a harsh negative judgment about 'Dad' and generalizes this judgment to his entire being and existence ('a man like this', 'waste of social resources'). This goes beyond an isolated incident to a broad, global negative evaluation. The phrase 'What such a man does alive is a waste of social resources!' is an extreme form of negative labeling. This is not simply emotional reasoning since the statements make explicit negative character labels. It is not fortune-telling or mind-reading since there is no prediction or assumed thoughts of others here; rather it's a global, derogatory judgment. It aligns best with Labeling, which is assigning a negative and generalized label to a person rather than describing specific behaviors.",Labeling
1818,"I can't even protect my own achievements, lose my job, and then suffer from freezing and starvation on the streets.","I can't even protect my own achievements, lose my job, suffer from freezing and starvation on the streets","The statement takes a negative event (potentially losing a job) and extrapolates it into an extreme and catastrophic outcome involving freezing and starvation on the streets. This involves predicting a highly unlikely future disaster without evidence, reflecting a pattern where the individual expects the worst possible scenario to happen. This matches the definition of 'Fortune-telling', where one predicts negative events without sufficient basis.",Fortune-telling
1819,"I have no job, but I do have more experience with my family and have used my time to learn some new technologies!","I have no job, but I do have more experience with my family and have used my time to learn some new technologies!","The statement acknowledges a negative fact ('I have no job') but immediately balances it by highlighting positive aspects ('more experience with my family' and 'learn some new technologies'). This shows a balanced perspective rather than a negative cognitive distortion. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or any other listed distortions because the speaker is not catastrophizing, assuming outcomes, or labeling themselves negatively.

The phrase ""It's been a long time since I've eaten so much"" implies an emphasis on a past event, potentially setting a rigid expectation. The phrase ""I really don't want to stick to it"" suggests resistance to maintaining or controlling this behavior (possibly eating less). This indicates an internal conflict connected to 'Should statements' — implying what the person feels they should or should not do regarding eating quantity, often expressed as self-imposed rules or obligations. There is no indication of extreme black-and-white thinking, emotional reasoning, or predictive statements present.",Should statements
1822,"I happen to have a dress I want to buy, I don't have a chance to buy it, and the sudden loss of pay makes me sad.","I don't have a chance to buy it, and the sudden loss of pay makes me sad.","The speaker connects the sudden loss of pay directly to feeling sad, implying that because of this external event, they feel a certain way. This aligns with emotional reasoning, where feelings are accepted as evidence of the truth of a situation. The statement does not show an all-or-nothing perspective, predictions about the future (fortune-telling), or other distortions.",Emotional Reasoning
1823,The teacher must have been here a long time to catch me and punish me.,The teacher must have been here a long time to catch me and punish me.,"The phrase 'must have been here a long time' indicates a strong assumption without evidence, where the speaker is predicting or guessing about the teacher's duration based on their own belief or feeling. This aligns with 'Fortune-telling,' a cognitive distortion where a person predicts negative outcomes or situations without sufficient proof.",Fortune-telling
1824,I can't always remember what people are doing to me. Things like this will probably be forgotten by me soon.,"""I can't always remember what people are doing to me.""; ""Things like this will probably be forgotten by me soon.""","The speaker is predicting a future event, specifically that they will forget what people are doing to them soon. This involves making a negative forecast without concrete evidence. The statement reflects an assumption about what will happen going forward, rather than a present fact. Since the distortion involves predicting the future negatively without certainty, it fits the definition of Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
1825,I'm never gonna be able to write this paper. I don't want to do it anymore.,"""I'm never gonna be able to write this paper.""","The statement reflects a belief that the speaker will 'never' succeed in writing the paper, which indicates an absolute and unqualified perspective. This suggests a black-and-white or 'all-or-nothing' mindset rather than a tentative or probabilistic view. The phrase ""never gonna be able"" is a key indicator of this cognitive distortion, implying a total failure without room for any success or improvement.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1826,"I'm suffering from physical pain and depression every day, and people around me can't understand that I can't feel it.","""people around me can't understand that I can't feel it""","The statement implies that the person believes others are aware of their feelings or thoughts (or lack thereof) but still do not understand.

1827,"I haven't been with the kids for so long, he'll blame me.","""I haven't been with the kids for so long"", ""he'll blame me""","The speaker assumes that because they haven't been with the kids for a long time, another person will definitely blame them. This involves making a prediction about someone else's thoughts or feelings without concrete evidence. The key cognitive distortion here is interpreting or assuming the internal state of another person (blaming) based on one's own fears or beliefs rather than objective facts, which aligns with mind reading.",Mind Reading
1828,"Maybe we can try to turn this darker into a virtuous competition, so that both of us can move forward.","Maybe we can try to turn this darker into a virtuous competition, so that both of us can move forward.","The statement expresses a hopeful approach to resolving a difficult situation by transforming it into a positive competition. It includes the word 'maybe,' which indicates uncertainty but does not definitively predict a negative or positive outcome. There's no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, magnifying negatives, mind reading, or personalization. The focus is on a potential positive future scenario, rather than an unchangeable fact or an emotional conclusion without evidence. Thus, the statement reflects constructive thinking rather than any cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
1829,It's all my own fault.,"""It's all my own fault.""","The statement assigns full blame to oneself for a situation. The key phrase 'all my own fault' indicates taking personal responsibility excessively, assuming complete causation where there may be other factors involved. This fits the definition of Personalization, where an individual credits themselves for negative events irrespective of external circumstances.",Personalization

This represents mind reading, as the speaker believes they know exactly what others think and feel. There is also a negative labeling of the self as a ""liability."" However, the core distortion here involves assuming others' internal states (mind reading) rather than solely self-labeling or other distortions. The speaker is predicting others' reactions with certainty, which fits mind reading more than fortune-telling because it's about others' mental states, not future events per se.",Mind Reading
1831,Qualified friends will take care of each other's emotions. I'm not a qualified friend.,"""Qualified friends will take care of each other's emotions."" and ""I'm not a qualified friend.""","The statement divides friends into two categories: 'qualified' ones who take care of each other's emotions and implicitly 'unqualified' ones who do not. The speaker labels themselves as 'not qualified,' suggesting a global, fixed trait. This is a clear example of labeling, where a person applies an absolute, negative label to themselves rather than considering a more nuanced view of their behavior or capacities.",Labeling
1832,Talk to them and let them know I'm not happy. I'm in the mood. I don't like it.,"'I'm not happy', 'I'm in the mood', 'I don't like it'","The speaker declares their emotional state ('I'm not happy', 'I don't like it') and uses that as a basis for their conclusion or decision ('Talk to them and let them know').

""I'll just drag people into trouble"" and ""They'll regret having me"" indicate assuming negative outcomes for the future without evidence, which aligns with predicting bad outcomes - typical of Fortune-telling. The statement ""Mom and Dad don't know how much money they spent on me"" suggests emotional reasoning or magnification, but the overall emphasis on predicting regret and trouble for others is stronger. Therefore, the primary cognitive distortion is Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
1834,"This girl, like her mother, knows to run out and never to call me. Women are like that in the world, they want money if they don't look at men.","This girl, like her mother, knows to run out and never to call me. Women are like that in the world, they want money if they don't look at men.","The statement uses a specific example ('this girl, like her mother') to make a broad generalization about all women ('Women are like that in the world'). This is a classic example of taking a few instances and assuming that they apply universally to a whole group. The speaker assumes all women behave the same way based on limited personal experience, which fits the definition of Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
1835,"It's a little uncertain and competitive, but I'm a smart, hard-working, hard-working man.","""It's a little uncertain and competitive"", ""I'm a smart, hard-working, hard-working man.""","The speaker acknowledges that the situation is uncertain and competitive, which is a realistic appraisal rather than an absolute negative or positive statement. Then the speaker focuses on positive self-attributes by calling themselves smart and hard-working. There is no evidence of exaggerating negatives or positives beyond a reasonable view, no reliance on feelings as facts, no assuming what others think, no predictions about the future, no labeling themselves or others negatively, and no use of ""should"" statements. The statement balances a mild concern with positive self-affirmation and does not distort the reality.",No Distortion
1836,It's my fault that I was too loud to scare her.,It's my fault that I was too loud to scare her.,"The speaker attributes the cause of scaring 'her' directly to themselves, taking personal responsibility for the outcome. This reflects an undue sense of personal responsibility for events influenced by external factors. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, magnification, or emotional reasoning here. The key cognitive distortion is the assumption that the event (scaring her) is entirely due to their own action (being loud), which aligns with 'Personalization.'",Personalization
1837,I'm either born or I'm stuck with a duck. It's bad luck.,"""I'm either born or I'm stuck with a duck. It's bad luck.""","The statement presents two extreme and mutually exclusive options: either 'I'm born' (implying inherent nature) or 'I'm stuck with a duck' (implying a fixed undesirable circumstance). This reflects a rigid black-and-white thinking pattern without any middle ground or nuance. The phrase 'It's bad luck' attributes a negative quality to the situation, but the essence of the distortion lies in the dichotomous framing. Therefore, the distortion aligns most closely with All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1838,It's annoying to be stood up. I shouldn't have made friends.,"""It's annoying to be stood up."" and ""I shouldn't have made friends.""","The first phrase expresses an emotional response to a situation but does not contain a cognitive distortion by itself. The second phrase ""I shouldn't have made friends"" involves the use of the word ""shouldn't,"" indicating a prescriptive statement about what the person believes they ought not to have done. This fits the 'Should statements' cognitive distortion, where a person imposes rigid rules or expectations on themselves, often leading to guilt or frustration.",Should statements

Am I too weak to be afraid to offend?,"""I'll make him think I'm not happy with him.""; ""Am I too weak to be afraid to offend?""","The speaker assumes they can control or predict the other person's thoughts (that he will think they are unhappy) without evidence, which aligns with 'Mind Reading.' Additionally, the self-questioning about being too weak to be afraid reflects internal judgment but doesn't form the core cognitive distortion here. The main distortion is assuming knowledge of what the other person is thinking.",Mind Reading

Additionally, the speaker predicts a negative future outcome ('I'm destined to be alone for a lifetime'), reflecting fortune-telling. Yet, the strongest distortion comes from the global negative prediction about their life and social acceptance with no evidence ('I'm destined to be alone for a lifetime', 'nobody wants to be with me'), which is a classic example of overgeneralization, where one negative aspect or belief is extended to an overall, permanent condition.",Overgeneralization
1841,"Every night I can't sleep, and the more I think about it, the more confused I get.","Every night I can't sleep, the more I think about it, the more confused I get","The key phrase 'Every night I can't sleep' suggests a pattern applied to all nights without exception, indicating a broad generalization. The phrase implies that one difficult event (sleeplessness on some nights) is extended to every night, which is a classic example of overgeneralization where a single or few instances are seen as a permanent, unchanging pattern.",Overgeneralization

This reflects reasoning based on how they feel, rather than objective evidence. The statement shows the speaker is interpreting reality through their emotional state, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
1843,"Family ties may not be frequent, but this will not weaken our deep ties.","""Family ties may not be frequent"", ""this will not weaken our deep ties""","The statement acknowledges that family interactions might not be frequent but asserts confidently that this lack of frequency will not diminish the strength of the ties. This reflects a balanced view without extreme conclusions or assumptions of negative outcomes. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or other cognitive distortions in this sentence. The statement is realistic and does not exaggerate or minimize aspects related to family ties.",No Distortion
1844,It's too much. It's too much for me.,"""It's too much. It's too much for me.""","The statement reflects a perception that the situation or task is overwhelmingly excessive specifically for the individual.

1846,How can I lose? Gambling is a lie!,"""How can I lose?"" and ""Gambling is a lie!""","The first phrase, 'How can I lose?', reflects an unrealistic expectation of never experiencing failure, which aligns with 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' where situations are viewed in extremes (win vs. lose). The second phrase, 'Gambling is a lie!', is a sweeping negative judgment about gambling, indicating an overgeneralization beyond facts. Since the speaker refuses to accept the possibility of losing and dismisses gambling entirely, this exemplifies an extreme black-and-white perspective rather than a nuanced view. Hence, the primary distortion is 'All-or-Nothing Thinking'.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

They won't trust me.","'If I fail this case, it will have some impact on my reputation.'; 'If there's ever a case in the future, people won't let me take it.'; 'They won't trust me.'","The statement starts with a realistic consequence of failing a case (impact on reputation), which is a factual possibility. However, the speaker then predicts future scenarios where, based on this one failure, people will never let them handle future cases and will completely distrust them. This involves predicting negative outcomes without concrete evidence, assuming an inevitable chain of events solely based on one incident. This fits the pattern of Fortune-telling, where the person assumes negative future outcomes despite uncertainty.",Fortune-telling
1848,I'm always worried about my face. It's gonna be my problem.,"""I'm always worried about my face"", ""It's gonna be my problem""","The statement ""I'm always worried about my face"" shows a tendency to predict a future negative outcome without concrete evidence, indicating a pattern of expecting something bad will definitely happen. This aligns with 'Fortune-telling,' as the speaker assumes their worry will definitely lead to a problem. The phrase ""It's gonna be my problem"" further reinforces the anticipation of an inevitable negative event. Although there is an emotional component in the worry expressed, the key distortion is the prediction of a negative future, rather than reasoning solely based on emotions or labeling.",Fortune-telling
1849,"Mom and Dad always cared about me, wherever I was, because they always had a sense of belonging, reminding me that I was a family kid.","Mom and Dad always cared about me, wherever I was; they always had a sense of belonging; reminding me that I was a family kid.","The statement emphasizes 'always' caring and having a sense of belonging, which is a strong generalization about the parents' behavior and feelings. There is a broad conclusion drawn from presumably many instances to a blanket statement applying to all times and situations. However, the statement lacks evidence of exaggeration, negative bias, or an emotional distortion. It appears to be a positive reflection rather than a negative distortion. The use of 'always' might suggest Overgeneralization, but since it is used in a positive and reassuring context without distortion, it does not fit distorted cognition patterns like All-or-Nothing or Emotional Reasoning. The sentence is more of an affirming belief rather than a cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
1850,"Try to resolve our conflicts with our roommates, because we all have our own thoughts.","Try to resolve our conflicts with our roommates, because we all have our own thoughts.","The statement suggests a recommendation to resolve conflicts based on acknowledging that each person has their own perspective. It reflects a consideration of multiple viewpoints rather than a rigid or distorted thought pattern. There is no evidence of extreme dichotomous thinking (All-or-Nothing), no emotional justification (Emotional Reasoning), no predicting the future negatively (Fortune-telling), no negative labeling, no exaggeration, no selective focus on negative details, or attributing thoughts to others without evidence (Mind Reading). It also does not involve blaming oneself unnecessarily (Personalization) or using 'should' statements to impose rules. Therefore, this statement does not present a cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
1851,"I suddenly lost my parents, and I will lose my loved ones and my children in the same way.","I suddenly lost my parents, and I will lose my loved ones and my children in the same way.","The statement takes a single tragic event (the loss of parents) and projects it onto all future similar events (losing loved ones and children). This is a classic case of drawing a broad and negative conclusion based on one instance, assuming that all future losses will occur exactly as this one did. The speaker is generalizing the experience of loss to an entire category of future losses without evidence, making it an overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

You don't love anyone!,"""You people are cold-blooded animals."", ""You don't love your dearest children."", ""You don't love anyone!""","The statement assigns a negative, absolute label to a group of people ('cold-blooded animals'), which is a form of labeling. It goes beyond describing behaviors or feelings to labeling their entire character in a derogatory way.

I'm gonna die alone.""","The statement presents a conclusion about the future ('I'm gonna die alone') based on the current identity ('I'm gay'). This reflects predicting a negative future outcome without concrete evidence. The repetition emphasizes the certainty of this prediction. This matches the distortion type where a person anticipates a negative event with absolute certainty, which is known as 'Fortune-telling.' It is not labeling because the speaker is not attaching a negative label to themselves; rather, they are making a negative prediction about their future. It is not overgeneralization since the statement is about a specific future event, not a broad negative generalization about many events. Emotional reasoning would involve basing truth on feelings, and here the statement is more about predicting the future outcome.",Fortune-telling
1854,I'll be a laughing stock for everyone.,"""I'll be a laughing stock for everyone.""","The statement predicts a negative future event where the speaker assumes they will be widely ridiculed by everyone. This prediction is made with certainty without evidence, reflecting a negative forecast of future events. The key cognitive distortion involves making a definitive negative prediction about the future, which fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling'. This is not labeling since the speaker is not assigning a fixed negative label to themselves, but rather anticipating a future outcome. It is also not mind reading, as it does not involve assuming others' thoughts, but rather predicting what will happen.",Fortune-telling

I must be a total loser, not worthy of love or respect.","""Does it really make sense for a man like me to live, just to waste the air?"", ""I must be a total loser, not worthy of love or respect.""",The statement shows the person is negatively judging themselves with a harsh global label ('total loser') based on their current feelings of tiredness and inability ('I can only feed myself'). This is not just a single negative thought but a broad evaluation of their entire worth and identity ('not worthy of love or respect'). The use of a broad negative label is characteristic of Labeling. The statement does not just indicate all-or-nothing thinking or fortune-telling but specifically assigns a negative category to themselves.,Labeling
1856,I'll never go out with him again.,"""I'll never go out with him again.""","The statement implies a definitive conclusion about all future instances based on a past experience or feeling. Using 'never' suggests that the person is making a sweeping judgment that there will be no exceptions or changes in the future. This reflects a pattern of thinking where one negative event or impression leads to a global conclusion, which is characteristic of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

If I'm good enough, I'll be admired by my colleagues, and she won't be able to influence me.","""If I'm good enough, I'll be admired by my colleagues"", ""she won't be able to influence me""","The statement predicts a future outcome based on the speaker being 'good enough' and assumes that this will guarantee admiration from colleagues and immunity from another person's influence. This reflects a prediction about how events will unfold without concrete evidence, fitting the definition of Fortune-telling, which involves anticipating outcomes negatively or positively without factual basis.",Fortune-telling

It's really dark.","""I'm being targeted by my driving coach"", ""who wants me to hang up every time so I can pay for it every year"", ""It's really dark.""","The speaker believes that the driving coach is intentionally targeting them with the motive of making them pay repeatedly. This implies attributing hostile or intentional motives to the coach without concrete evidence, which aligns with 'mind reading' – assuming to know someone’s thoughts or intentions negatively. The mention of 'It's really dark' suggests a sense of gloom or hopelessness, supporting the emotional tone but not overriding the key distortion. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions. The primary distortion is assuming the coach's negative intent without proof, characteristic of 'Mind Reading.'",Mind Reading
1859,"I feel like I'm a burden to everyone. I'm sorry, I'm a terrible person.","""I feel like I'm a burden to everyone."" and ""I'm sorry, I'm a terrible person.""","The statement ""I feel like I'm a burden to everyone"" reflects an assumption that others view the speaker negatively without concrete evidence, which aligns with mind reading. The phrase ""I'm a terrible person"" is a global negative label attributed to oneself based on these feelings, signifying labeling. However, the dominant distortion here is labeling because the speaker labels themselves negatively (terrible person) based on subjective feelings, which is a hallmark of labeling. Emotional reasoning is partly present due to reliance on feelings, but the core distortion is labeling as it involves a deep negative self-assessment.",Labeling

I'm never gonna get a job!,"""I'm gonna blow this interview."", ""It's over."", ""I'm never gonna get a job!""","The speaker predicts a negative outcome regarding the interview without evidence ('I'm gonna blow this interview'). They then conclude with a definitive and negative forecast about their entire future job prospects ('I'm never gonna get a job!'). This involves making a negative prediction about future events with certainty, characteristic of 'Fortune-telling'. Additionally, the generalization to 'never getting a job' after one event shows an element of 'Overgeneralization'. However, since the focus is on predicting failure before it happens, the primary distortion is 'Fortune-telling'.",Fortune-telling
1861,Are you a real mind reader? How do you know why I asked?,Are you a real mind reader? How do you know why I asked?,"The statement implies that someone is assumed to know what the speaker is thinking or the reason behind their question without explicit communication. This aligns directly with the definition of 'Mind Reading,' which is a cognitive distortion where one believes they know another person's thoughts or intentions without sufficient evidence. The speaker is challenging the assumption that the other person can 'read their mind.'",Mind Reading

There is no evidence of black-and-white thinking, exaggerated negative interpretation, or any prediction about the future. The phrase 'good enough' suggests acceptance rather than an unrealistic standard ('should' statement), labeling, or magnification. The statement does not assume others' thoughts, nor does it rely on feelings as proof of reality. Therefore, the statement does not fit any cognitive distortion and appears to be a balanced expression of personal values and contentment with the social circle.",No Distortion

There is no indication of an extreme black-and-white viewpoint, predicting the future, negative labeling, or interpreting others' thoughts. The statement reflects an acceptance rather than a cognitive distortion. They are not using emotional reasoning or magnifying negatives, nor making generalized statements about themselves or others.

The speaker assumes that the source of trouble lies entirely with 'them' and dismisses their value by stating 'I don't care about them.' This reflects a negative global judgment about this group based on limited experiences, suggesting a broad conclusion about a type of people. The statement does not speculate about the future (ruling out Fortune-telling), nor does it reflect just emotional state as fact (emotional reasoning). It does not employ extreme absolutes or all-or-nothing terms explicitly, nor does it include 'should' language. The key distortion is seeing a specific negative interaction as indicative that all people who care and help are problematic, which aligns with Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

The phrase 'I just can't have friends' reflects a broad, absolute conclusion about the ability to have friends, indicating Overgeneralization. Finally, 'my friends left me one after the other' suggests perceiving a pattern that supports the overgeneralized belief. Among these, the initial self-label 'I'm such an asshole' is a direct example of Labeling, which is a specific category distinct from Overgeneralization. The blaming of oneself for friends leaving could also suggest Personalization, but since the key cognitive distortion is the negative global label, Labeling is the best fit.",Labeling

""I'm gonna have to pay a lot of money.""","The statement claims to know exactly what others are thinking without any evidence (""must be thinking about how to blackmail me better""), which fits the definition of Mind Reading. Additionally, it predicts a negative future outcome (""I'm gonna have to pay a lot of money"") without certainty, indicating Fortune-telling. However, the primary distortion is the assumption about others' thoughts, since it directly attributes malicious intent to the naked people, making Mind Reading the dominant distortion. Fortune-telling is secondary but less explicit.",Mind Reading
1872,"My family communicates directly with me, and they like to talk about things and not talk to each other.","My family communicates directly with me, and they like to talk about things and not talk to each other.","The statement suggests that the person believes their family members do not communicate with each other, only directly with the speaker. This reflects an assumption about others' internal behaviors or thoughts without concrete evidence. The key cognitive distortion involves assuming knowledge about other people's intentions or interactions without explicit evidence, which aligns with 'Mind Reading.' There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, labeling, magnification, mental filtering, overgeneralization, personalization, or 'should' statements here.",Mind Reading

This indicates taking one or more instances or feelings and extending them to a universal rule about the self. The term ""hard-core paper tiger"" also contributes a negative label but the dominant feature is the sweeping negative self-assessment that applies to all situations. There is no evidence of black-and-white thinking, or other distortions like fortune-telling or mind reading here. The statement primarily shows a generalization from limited evidence leading to a rigid belief about oneself.",Overgeneralization

This is indicative of the cognitive distortion called Labeling, where individuals assign a fixed and negative label to others based on behavior or feelings. Although there is emotional content and fear, the primary distortion here is the use of a derogatory and absolute label for the family, rather than emotional reasoning or other distortions.",Labeling
1876,It's okay. It's not a big problem. I sleep pretty every day.,"""It's okay"", ""It's not a big problem"", ""I sleep pretty every day""","The statement minimizes the significance of a problem by saying ""It's okay"" and ""It's not a big problem"". The speaker appears to downplay concerns, which could indicate an attempt to reduce worry or anxiety. The phrase ""I sleep pretty every day"" suggests an attempt to assure oneself or others that things are generally fine. There is no indication of extremes (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or attributing motives to others (Mind Reading). Nor is there labeling or personalization. The statement is more about minimizing or dismissing the issue at hand rather than magnifying it. Since the speaker acknowledges the situation but reframes it as manageable, this aligns with No Distortion rather than a cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

This involves taking things personally and assuming control over others' reactions, which aligns with the concept of 'Personalization'. It is not an example of assuming absolute categories (All-or-Nothing), interpreting feelings as facts (Emotional Reasoning), predicting future outcomes (Fortune-telling), making generalized self-labels (Labeling), exaggerating negatives (Magnification), focusing on a single negative detail (Mental filter), assuming to know others' thoughts without evidence (Mind Reading), making broad conclusions from a single event (Overgeneralization), or expressing rigid rules (Should statements).",Personalization

This is characteristic of 'Should statements,' where someone imposes strict rules or expectations on themselves or others. The focus on avoiding gossip and protecting someone from problems implies rigid self-imposed rules about behavior. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or other distortions here; rather, it is a clear use of 'need to' as a 'should' statement.",Should statements

However, the focus immediately shifts to a positive aspect: the warmth shared, which is stated as more important than anything else, even persisting despite the cold weather. The speaker is emphasizing an emotional truth (the warmth shared) over the literal fact (no one brought it). This demonstrates reasoning from an emotional state rather than objective evidence. The key distortion is interpreting the situation based on feelings of warmth and connection rather than the factual absence of 'it'. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where one assumes that because something feels a certain way, it must be true.",Emotional Reasoning

I'm such an unqualified friend.","""He used me as a friend"", ""I didn't agree with him"", ""I'm such an unqualified friend""","The statement ""I'm such an unqualified friend"" is a global negative label applied to the self based on a specific event or disagreement. Despite only describing a particular interaction where the speaker disagreed with the other person, they generalize this to their entire identity as a friend. This broad negative self-label fits the definition of labeling, where one assigns a fixed, global negative trait to oneself rather than viewing the behavior or situation more objectively or specifically.",Labeling
1885,It's worse to be in a mood like this than to die.,"""It's worse to be in a mood like this than to die.""","The statement expresses an extreme comparison between the emotional state ('a mood like this') and death, suggesting that the mood is catastrophically worse than dying. This reflects an exaggeration of the negative aspect of the current mood without considering gradations or alternatives. The person is magnifying the discomfort of their mood to an irrational and disproportionate degree. Therefore, the distortion involves making the situation seem far worse than it objectively is.",Magnification
1886,What if I can't find a job for the rest of my life?,"""What if I can't find a job for the rest of my life?""","The statement predicts a negative outcome far into the future without evidence, assuming a worst-case scenario will certainly happen. This fits the pattern of making a specific prediction about the future in a negative way, which is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling.' It is not all-or-nothing thinking because it focuses on one potential outcome, nor overgeneralization since it is about a specific scenario. There is no labeling or personalization involved. The statement is primarily about predicting a negative future event without certainty.",Fortune-telling
1887,Boyfriend says he needs more space. It means we're fucked.,"""Boyfriend says he needs more space"" and ""It means we're fucked.""","The statement interprets the boyfriend's request for more space as a definite and catastrophic outcome ('we're fucked').

The distortion lies in jumping to a negative conclusion about the future, which is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling'.",Fortune-telling
1888,Exchanges with family members are really rather rare and sometimes feel isolated.,Exchanges with family members are really rather rare and sometimes feel isolated,"The statement focuses specifically on the rarity of exchanges with family members and then emphasizes the feeling of isolation that sometimes arises. It highlights negative elements (rare exchanges, feeling isolated) and disregards any possible positive interactions or occasions that may occur. This selective attention to the negative aspects of family interaction, ignoring the potentially neutral or positive parts, suggests the use of a mental filter cognitive distortion.",Mental filter
1889,"The confident ones are the most beautiful, so I am the most beautiful.","""The confident ones are the most beautiful"", ""so I am the most beautiful""","The statement makes a broad generalization by categorizing confident people as the most beautiful and then applies this category to oneself as a conclusion. This indicates a generalized rule based on a single characteristic (confidence) that leads to a definitive conclusion about beauty. It does not involve an absolute either/or condition (all-or-nothing), prediction of the future (fortune-telling), or misattributing thoughts or emotions (mind reading, emotional reasoning). Instead, the reasoning reflects an overgeneralized belief linking confidence with beauty and extending that categorization to the self without nuance.",Overgeneralization

The statement ""They must've known what my illness was, but they wouldn't tell me!"" implies assuming the intentions and knowledge of the hospital staff without concrete evidence, which is an example of mind reading. However, since the strongest cognitive distortion here is the use of a negative label applied to the hospital as a whole, the primary distortion is labeling.",Labeling
1891,"I can never bring any value to the people around me, whether family or friends, but only to others.","""I can never bring any value to the people around me, whether family or friends, but only to others.""","The statement uses the word 'never,' indicating an absolute and sweeping conclusion about the speaker's ability to bring value to family or friends.

The second part, ""I'm a very special guy,"" implies a label placed on oneself emphasizing uniqueness or superiority. This self-description aligns most closely with the distortion called Labeling, where a person assigns a fixed, often exaggerated or absolute, trait or identity to themselves.",Labeling
1893,"I can't do business anymore, and I'm finished.","""I can't do business anymore"", ""I'm finished""","The statement expresses a totalizing and absolute conclusion, implying that because of a current difficulty or failure, the speaker's ability to do business is completely gone and their situation is irredeemable.

1895,I'm tired of the company's recent downsizing.,tired of the company's recent downsizing,"The statement expresses a feeling of fatigue related to a specific event (the company's recent downsizing). It does not contain a categorical, black-and-white judgment (all-or-nothing), prediction of future outcomes (fortune-telling), interpreting others' thoughts (mind reading), or broad generalizations (overgeneralization). It also doesn't involve labeling or personalization. The subjective feeling ('I'm tired') is based on an emotional response to the situation, but the statement does not claim that the emotion reflects an objective truth. Therefore, the distortion is characterized by reasoning from an emotional standpoint—concluding something about the situation because of the feeling ('tired'). This fits the characteristic of Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
1896,Why would he say that to me?,"""Why would he say that to me?""","The statement involves assuming the intentions or reasons behind another person's behavior without evidence.

This is characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where things are viewed in black-and-white terms without any middle ground.

There's nothing I can do, so I have to try harder.","""They're smarter than me""; ""There's nothing I can do""; ""I have to try harder""","The phrase ""They're smarter than me"" indicates a fixed comparison and possible negative self-labeling. ""There's nothing I can do"" reflects a sense of helplessness or inevitability, which suggests a form of fortune-telling or predicting a negative outcome as unchangeable. However, the statement ends with ""I have to try harder,"" which contradicts a sense of helplessness by implying effort can influence the situation. The main distortion lies in the belief that others are inherently smarter (labeling self as inferior) and the perceived inevitable disadvantage (fortune-telling about inability to compete). Between these, the emphasis on a fixed intelligence difference represents a negative label applied to self compared to others. Thus, the dominant distortion is Labeling.",Labeling

I worry my parents.","""I'm such a piece of shit."", ""I don't do anything well."", ""I worry my parents.""","The speaker uses highly negative and global labels about themselves (""piece of shit""), which is indicative of Labeling. This is a cognitive distortion where one assigns a harsh and entirely negative label to oneself based on perceived failures or flaws. Additionally, the phrase ""I don't do anything well"" suggests a global negative evaluation of their abilities. The worry about parents may be based on assumptions about how others perceive them, but the dominant distortion present is Labeling due to the strong self-directed name-calling.",Labeling

The phrase 'if I can't even find a suitable person' suggests that without this condition being met, happiness in marriage is impossible. This reflects a black-and-white view without considering any middle ground or alternative possibilities, which is characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking.

They seem to blame themselves and express a sense of pity ('sorry for myself'), which suggests an emotional evaluation rather than objective reasoning. The phrase 'now lives in such a mess' indicates a perception dominated by negative emotion. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where the person assumes their emotional state reflects facts about their reality. There is no evidence of extremes (All-or-Nothing), predicting future outcomes (Fortune-telling), exaggeration (Magnification), global labeling, or specific self-imposed rules (Should). The focus is on feelings dictating perceived reality.",Emotional Reasoning
1904,"I'm also bluffing with my friends to make them rich, so they can laugh at me.","""bluffing with my friends to make them rich"", ""so they can laugh at me""","The speaker assumes that their friends will laugh at them as a consequence of their actions (bluffing), without any concrete evidence. This reflects the speaker predicting a negative outcome (being laughed at) with certainty. This assumption about future events fits the distortion of 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts negative outcomes without basis.",Fortune-telling
1905,I really don't like to work. It's really fucked up.,"""I really don't like to work""; ""It's really fucked up.""","The statement expresses a strong negative feeling about work without specific evidence or examples. The phrase ""It's really fucked up"" is a harsh, global negative judgment that applies an extreme and absolute label to the situation. This suggests a tendency to view work in a totally negative light, which aligns with all-or-nothing thinking, but it does not explicitly show polarized extremes such as 'always' or 'never'. It also reflects emotional reasoning because the speaker is concluding that work is ""fucked up"" based solely on their negative feelings rather than objective evidence. Therefore, the distortion is primarily about making a reality judgment based on emotion rather than facts.",Emotional Reasoning
1906,I can't help it. I'll just have to order another one. It's a small matter that won't be handled by the police.,"""I can't help it."", ""I'll just have to order another one."", ""It's a small matter that won't be handled by the police.""","The speaker assumes that because the issue is considered 'small,' it will definitely not be addressed by the police. This involves predicting a negative outcome without concrete evidence, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling.' They also display a sense of helplessness and resignation in 'I can't help it,' which supports the inevitability of this predicted outcome. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or other distortions here.",Fortune-telling
1907,"It's kind of a bad situation, and I'm sure I can focus on it if I just adjust.","""It's kind of a bad situation"", ""I'm sure I can focus on it if I just adjust""","The statement acknowledges a negative situation but expresses a positive and realistic belief in coping by adjusting focus. It does not involve all-or-nothing thinking since the speaker does not see the situation as entirely bad or impossible to handle. There is no assumption about future outcomes (Fortune-telling), nor is there labeling, mind reading, or personalization. The speaker does not use emotional reasoning or magnify the problem; instead, they show a balanced view. There are no should statements, overgeneralizations, or mental filters. The statement reflects a grounded assessment with an adaptive outlook.",No Distortion
1908,It's not my decision. It's been so long. It's time for me to get over it.,"""It's not my decision."" ""It's been so long."" ""It's time for me to get over it.""","The speaker suggests that because a long time has passed, they should move past the issue. This reflects an internal 'should' rule about how they ought to feel or behave, regardless of their actual emotions or readiness. The statements imply an expectation or obligation ('It's time for me to get over it'), which aligns with 'Should statements' cognitive distortion, where individuals impose strict rules on themselves.",Should statements
1909,I'm supposed to get paid for getting through these stressful times.,"""I'm supposed to get paid for getting through these stressful times.""","The phrase uses the word 'supposed to,' which indicates an expectation or a rule about how things should be. This reflects the cognitive distortion where a person imposes rigid 'should' rules or obligations on themselves or others. The person believes there is an obligation or entitlement to get paid simply for enduring stress, which fits the pattern of 'Should statements'.",Should statements
1910,"There's a supermarket up ahead. Come on, we're almost there.","""There's a supermarket up ahead. Come on, we're almost there.""","The statement is a simple factual observation followed by encouragement.

It expresses a hopeful and realistic assessment of the situation.",No Distortion

The repeated phrase ""he's so mean"" is a form of labeling, where the boss is negatively labeled rather than considering specific behaviors. The phrase ""I'm gonna get him into trouble"" suggests a reactive idea possibly tied to personalization or fortune-telling, but is less clear. The phrases ""It's not safe"" and ""I'll never be here again"" express a prediction about the future based on feelings, indicating fortune-telling. However, the statement also shows an absolute categorization of the boss as ""so mean"" and the conclusion that the environment is unsafe and the speaker will not return, which suggests overgeneralization or all-or-nothing thinking. Considering the entire context, the strongest distortion is Labeling because the boss is assigned a harsh negative label ""so mean"" that drives the emotional and predictive conclusions.",Labeling
1912,"School activities must be full of small groups. I can't fit in, I can't join.","""School activities must be full of small groups."" ""I can't fit in, I can't join.""","The phrase ""must be"" indicates a rigid rule or expectation, characteristic of 'Should statements'. The belief that school activities have to be in small groups shows inflexibility. The following statements ""I can't fit in, I can't join"" reflect a negative conclusion based on that rigid expectation. While there is an element of overgeneralization in 'I can't fit in, I can't join', the driving distortion is the imposed 'must' that sets this negative belief into motion. Therefore, 'Should statements' best captures the cognitive distortion here.",Should statements
1913,I'm worried about the test. I hate it. It's a breakdown.,"""I'm worried about the test"", ""I hate it"", ""It's a breakdown""","The phrase ""It's a breakdown"" suggests the person is interpreting the situation as a complete failure or disaster. This indicates a tendency to view the event in extreme, all-or-nothing terms rather than considering a spectrum of possible outcomes or degrees of difficulty. They are not simply worried or dislike the test; they categorize it as a total negative catastrophe, which aligns with the characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1914,"I'm so lonely, I don't think anybody wants a puppy, I just don't want a dog, they just care about their own business, they want to die, so they won't be so lonely.","""I'm so lonely"", ""nobody wants a puppy"", ""they just care about their own business"", ""they want to die, so they won't be so lonely""","The speaker makes broad negative assumptions about others' intentions and feelings without concrete evidence (e.g., ""nobody wants a puppy"", ""they just care about their own business"", ""they want to die""). This indicates predicting or assuming others’ mental states and future behaviors. The statement reflects assumptions about others' thoughts and intentions that cannot be known for sure, fitting the pattern of 'Mind Reading' or 'Fortune-telling'. However, since the speaker projects internal states onto others, thinking that they want to die to avoid loneliness, this involves attributing thoughts/intentions to others. The distortion is best matched with 'Mind Reading', which involves assuming one knows what others are thinking or feeling.",Mind Reading
1915,"The teacher's strictness is for our own good, he's punished this time, and he'll remember his homework the next time. The teacher must think I'm an immature student to punish me so severely.","The teacher's strictness is for our own good, he's punished this time, and he'll remember his homework the next time. The teacher must think I'm an immature student to punish me so severely.","The sentence contains an assumption about the teacher's thoughts without any direct evidence, which is a key feature of Mind Reading. The speaker assumes the teacher thinks they are immature simply based on the punishment given, rather than knowing the teacher's true thoughts. The other parts reflect some understanding of cause and effect, but the core distortion is the assumption of knowing what the teacher thinks. This is not All-or-Nothing Thinking as there is no extreme dichotomy, nor Emotional Reasoning because it is more about assumed beliefs rather than emotional states. Fortune-telling is about predicting future events, which is not the focus here. Labeling would involve defining oneself or others with negative global labels, which is close but not quite the assumption about the teacher's mind. Therefore, Mind Reading is the best fit.",Mind Reading
1916,"It's hard to blame anyone. If I had to study earlier, I'd be better prepared to answer two questions.","""If I had to study earlier, I'd be better prepared to answer two questions.""","The statement contains the phrase ""If I had to study earlier,"" which reflects an expectation or rule about how one should act. This aligns with the 'Should statements' distortion, where the person imposes rigid standards or expectations on themselves. The idea that studying earlier would lead to better preparation shows the use of 'should' as a form of self-criticism or judgment. The rest of the sentence does not emphasize extremes, emotional feelings, or assumptions about others' thoughts or the future, so other distortion types do not fit as well.",Should statements
1917,"My roommate also received a scholarship, but he didn't study well, either. He was close to the teacher. He must have bribed the teacher.","""He was close to the teacher. He must have bribed the teacher.""","The person assumes, without evidence, that the roommate bribed the teacher based on proximity or relationship with the teacher. This reflects a conclusion about another's behavior and intentions without concrete proof. This fits the definition of Mind Reading, where one presumes to know others' thoughts or motives negatively without factual basis.",Mind Reading
1918,"It must have been the one who told the story, because he liked the boy, and she wanted me to be ugly to make him hate me.","he liked the boy, and she wanted me to be ugly to make him hate me","The statement assumes the motives and thoughts of others without direct evidence, specifically that 'he liked the boy' and 'she wanted me to be ugly to make him hate me.' This reflects an assumption about other people's internal states and intentions. The speaker is attributing specific desires and intentions to others, which constitutes mind reading.",Mind Reading
1919,"Oh, my work. Thank you. I've had 20 years of low blood pressure. Have a drink and calm down.","""I've had 20 years of low blood pressure. Have a drink and calm down.""","The statement references a long-term condition ('20 years of low blood pressure') and immediately suggests a coping action ('Have a drink and calm down'), implying an emotional response is being used to justify behavior. This suggests relying on current feelings to guide the action rather than an objective assessment. However, there is no indication that the speaker is making an emotional conclusion without evidence, or distorting facts based on feelings alone. The statement does not categorize events in extremes or make broad generalizations, nor does it assign labels or assume others' thoughts. The phrase is more of a comforting or calming self-instruction. It does not express a clear cognitive distortion but rather a rational or neutral commentary on personal health and behavior.",No Distortion

The person assumes they know what will happen (family not talking much) based on a situation (not being bothered). This shows making a negative prediction about the future, which fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling'. It is not simply mind reading (assuming knowing thoughts) because the statement is about the future action, nor is it an emotional reasoning or overgeneralization. Therefore, the distortion that best fits this statement is Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
1922,Fighting with parents is not what I want. Next time I should be more calm and avoid fighting.,"""Next time I should be more calm and avoid fighting.""","The sentence includes the phrase ""should be more calm and avoid fighting,"" which reflects a statement about how the person believes they ought to behave. 'Should statements' are cognitive distortions where one imposes strict rules on oneself or others about how things must be, often resulting in guilt or frustration. This does not reflect other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking or personalization, but clearly demonstrates an internal demand or rule about behavior.",Should statements
1923,You all look down on me and feel like I can't even pay the bride price. I'm a pathetic person.,"""You all look down on me"", ""feel like I can't even pay the bride price"", ""I'm a pathetic person""","The phrase ""You all look down on me"" suggests the speaker believes they know what others are thinking without explicit evidence, indicating mind reading. The speaker's conclusion that they are ""a pathetic person"" based on these perceived thoughts is an example of labeling, as they assign a broad negative label to themselves. However, the key distortion driving the belief is the assumption about others' thoughts ('You all look down on me'), which fits the Mind Reading distortion more directly than Labeling, as the label is a consequence of the assumed thoughts, not an independent distortion here.",Mind Reading
1924,Why don't I just fall to death and leave the world to trouble others?,"""Why don't I just fall to death and leave the world to trouble others?""","The statement reflects a negative and extreme conclusion about oneself and the world, implying that the speaker's existence is a burden and that the world would be better off without them. However, it does not include predictions about the future (Fortune-telling), generalized statements about everyone (Overgeneralization), or direct labeling of self or others with specific negative terms (Labeling). It also does not involve dichotomous thinking (All-or-Nothing), interpreting feelings as factual reality (Emotional Reasoning), focusing solely on negative details (Mental filter), assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading), blaming oneself for things outside control (Personalization), or imposing rules about how things ""should"" be (Should statements). Instead, the statement expresses an intense emotional conclusion possibly reflecting distorted emotional reasoning where feelings of worthlessness and despair are treated as facts justifying a drastic action. Thus, the distortion most closely aligned is Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
1925,I'm an evil man and I shouldn't be their child.,I'm an evil man; I shouldn't be their child,"The phrase 'I'm an evil man' is a negative, absolute self-label rather than seeing specific behaviors; this aligns with labeling, which involves assigning a global negative identity to oneself. The statement 'I shouldn't be their child' reflects a prescriptive judgment based on this label, but the core distortion is the negative self-labeling. This is not all-or-nothing thinking because it's not presenting a dichotomy, nor is it primarily emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, or other distortions. Therefore, the main distortion here is 'Labeling.'",Labeling
1926,"I can't learn anything, I can't concentrate, I'll never have law.","""I can't learn anything"", ""I can't concentrate"", ""I'll never have law""","The statement includes broad, sweeping conclusions about the speaker's abilities and future based on current feelings or situations. Saying ""I can't learn anything"" and ""I can't concentrate"" generalizes the current difficulty to all learning and concentration. The phrase ""I'll never have law"" suggests a definitive, negative prediction about the future. This aligns with 'Overgeneralization', where one believes that a single negative event or situation will always be true and applies to all circumstances.",Overgeneralization
1927,It's hard to tell me in this way. He must think I'm not worthy of his honesty.,"""He must think I'm not worthy of his honesty.""","The statement assumes knowledge of another person's thoughts or beliefs without concrete evidence.

1929,Patients are son of a bitch. Ungrateful things.,"""Patients are son of a bitch"" and ""Ungrateful things""","The statement applies a harsh negative label to an entire group (patients) without nuance or exceptions.

Bad luck.","""Bad luck, bad luck."", ""I'm being bullied on my way."", ""I can't get any good anywhere."", ""Bad luck.""","The speaker repeats ""bad luck"" as a reason for their negative experiences, implying a belief that unavoidable misfortune is causing their problems. The phrase ""I can't get any good anywhere"" generalizes a current negative experience to all situations. This indicates the speaker is jumping to conclusions about the future and the overall nature of their experiences without concrete evidence. This fits the definition of Fortune-telling, where one predicts negative outcomes without sufficient evidence. The statement does not reflect all-or-nothing thinking or labeling, nor does it indicate emotional reasoning, magnification, or personalization primarily. Overgeneralization is present, but the emphasis on predicting bad outcomes (fortune-telling) is stronger due to the repeated assumption of ongoing bad luck.",Fortune-telling
1931,My parents are in bad health and they may never recover.,"""My parents are in bad health""; ""they may never recover""","The statement expresses a negative prediction about the future health outcomes of the parents without sufficient evidence.

1932,He's old enough to have this kind of thing happening to him. It's an old man.,"""He's old enough to have this kind of thing happening to him."" ""It's an old man.""","The statement assigns a characteristic or expectation to someone based solely on their age, effectively labeling the person as 'an old man' and implying that certain negative things are expected or normal for him because of this label. This generalization based on a defining characteristic fits closely with the concept of 'Labeling,' where a person is categorized based on an attribute.",Labeling

1934,I can comfort her until she's in a good mood.,I can comfort her until she's in a good mood,"The statement implies that the speaker believes their actions (comforting her) will directly cause a specific outcome (her being in a good mood). This reflects an assumption about the future outcome based on their current effort, which aligns with predicting how events will unfold without certainty. It suggests the speaker is forecasting an emotional state that may not be guaranteed. This fits the definition of Fortune-telling, where one predicts future events negatively or positively without evidence.",Fortune-telling

The speaker is personalizing the situation by taking blame for an event that might have been indirectly linked to their actions or statements, extending responsibility beyond what is clearly warranted. There is an element of assuming personal fault for consequences that are not definitively caused by them, which aligns with the definition of Personalization.",Personalization

1937,I'm so useless. I haven't saved any money for so long.,"""I'm so useless"", ""I haven't saved any money for so long""","The key phrase 'I'm so useless' is a global negative evaluation of the self based on a specific behavior ('I haven't saved any money for so long'). This reflects labeling, where the individual assigns a negative and broad label to themselves instead of focusing on a specific action or situation. The statement 'I haven't saved any money for so long' is factual and serves as the basis for the label, but the distortion lies in the extreme and global self-judgment 'useless'.",Labeling
1938,The cars that come around are so noisy that I can't sleep.,The cars that come around are so noisy that I can't sleep.,"The statement focuses on the noise from cars as the cause of the inability to sleep, implying a direct emotional experience (distress/discomfort) tied to the noise. It accepts the feeling as evidence that sleep is impossible because of the noise, which reflects reasoning based on feeling rather than objective analysis. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, generalized beliefs, or predictions about the future. The key distortion is relying on emotional experience to conclude an objective fact (cannot sleep due to noise).",Emotional Reasoning
1939,That's my favorite lunch! I've been hungry all afternoon and this son of a bitch stole it!,That's my favorite lunch! I've been hungry all afternoon and this son of a bitch stole it!,"The speaker is reacting with strong emotion to the theft of their lunch. They assume the person who took the lunch did so intentionally and maliciously (calling them 'son of a bitch'), which indicates a negative label towards that person. This is an example of ""Labeling"" because the speaker assigns a harsh, negative label to the individual based on this event, which colors their entire perception. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking or fortune-telling here, but rather a judgmental name-calling based on a single incident.",Labeling

This reflects a rigid all-or-nothing perspective, where the speaker sees electronics in wholly negative terms without nuance or middle ground. It is not just a specific device but all modern electronics that are rejected, showing a categorical thinking pattern. There is no evidence of predicting future events (fortune-telling), interpreting others' thoughts (mind reading), or emotional reasoning alone. The use of a totalizing negative label on all electronics fits best with All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1941,I don't have any friends in this new environment.,I don't have any friends in this new environment,"The statement implies a complete absence of friends in the new environment, which generalizes the situation into an absolute condition without exceptions.

""I can't do this"" shows a sense of defeat but is more linked to negative self-labeling than all-or-nothing thinking, which would involve absolutes like ""always"" or ""never."" ""I'm so tired all day"" is an observation and expresses exhaustion but does not itself constitute a distortion. The dominant distortion is negative labeling of the self.",Labeling

1958,My life won't be a success if I try so hard.,"""My life won't be a success if I try so hard.""","The statement implies a rigid, black-and-white viewpoint where the effort made (trying hard) is directly linked to the absolute outcome (success or no success). It suggests that despite trying hard, success is impossible, which negates any middle ground or partial success and ignores other factors influencing success. This fits the pattern of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where situations are viewed in extremes without acknowledging nuance or gradation.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1959,"There's probably too much trouble lately, and I can't afford to learn.","""There's probably too much trouble lately"", ""I can't afford to learn""","The phrase ""There's probably too much trouble lately"" indicates a prediction about current/future difficulties, which reflects an expectation of problems without certainty. The use of ""probably"" suggests an assumption about future or ongoing hardship without evidence, fitting the definition of Fortune-telling, where one predicts negative outcomes. The statement ""I can't afford to learn"" reinforces this prediction, implying that the speaker believes circumstances won't allow for learning due to these anticipated troubles.",Fortune-telling
1960,Or was it because I was so bad that I didn't make it?,I was so bad that I didn't make it,"The statement assumes a negative personal quality ('I was so bad') as the definitive cause for failing ('that I didn't make it'), reflecting self-blame and a global, negative label applied to oneself. This is indicative of 'Labeling', where a person assigns a negative label to themselves based on a single event or outcome.",Labeling
1961,It's so sleepy. It's gonna be tough during the day.,"""It's so sleepy."" and ""It's gonna be tough during the day.""","The phrase ""It's so sleepy"" indicates a current feeling of sleepiness, which is an emotional state. The follow-up ""It's gonna be tough during the day"" predicts a negative outcome based primarily on this emotional state. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the person's feelings (sleepiness) are used as evidence to assume that the day will be difficult without concrete evidence supporting this prediction. It is not Fortune-telling because the statement is based on an emotional state rather than knowledge or data about the future. It is not All-or-Nothing thinking or Overgeneralization because no absolute terms are used. Therefore, the cognitive distortion here is Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
1962,"I made my father angry, and I couldn't do anything.","""I made my father angry"", ""I couldn't do anything""","The statement assumes direct causation between the speaker's actions and the father's anger, indicating the speaker takes personal responsibility for the father's emotional state (personalization). Additionally, the phrase ""I couldn't do anything"" suggests a feeling of helplessness or inability to change the situation. However, the key distortion lies in taking personal blame without considering other factors that might have contributed to the father's anger, which aligns with personalization rather than other distortions like emotional reasoning or mind reading.",Personalization
1963,"My colleagues see me as an intern, they don't know anything, they're doing so much work for me, they're easy. I'm doing so much as I'm paid!","""My colleagues see me as an intern"", ""they don't know anything"", ""they're doing so much work for me"", ""I'm doing so much as I'm paid""","The speaker makes assumptions about how colleagues perceive them (""My colleagues see me as an intern"") without direct evidence, reflecting mind reading. They also make generalized negative judgments about others' knowledge (""they don't know anything"") and interpret the effort of colleagues as being easy compared to their own work, showing an unfair evaluation. However, the primary distortion lies in assuming to know others' thoughts and opinions without proof.",Mind Reading
1964,I'm a man who doesn't help anyone.,"""I'm a man who doesn't help anyone.""","The statement generalizes a characterization about oneself by stating that the speaker 'doesn't help anyone.' This implies a broad, sweeping judgment without exceptions, indicating an all-encompassing negative label. The phrase suggests a global negative conclusion based on possibly limited evidence, reflecting a cognitive distortion that categorizes behavior in absolute terms.",Overgeneralization
1965,"I want to adjust, but I'm really not happy. I don't want to pretend.","""I'm really not happy"" and ""I don't want to pretend""","The statement expresses a feeling of unhappiness and a refusal to act as if feeling differently, highlighting a reliance on feelings to determine reality. There is an assumption that because the person feels unhappy, this feeling accurately reflects the situation, without considering other possible interpretations or external evidence.",Emotional Reasoning
1966,It's my fault I didn't learn to upset my father.,"""It's my fault""","The phrase ""It's my fault"" indicates the speaker is blaming themselves for an outcome that likely involves other factors or people. This is a clear example of Personalization, where an individual attributes responsibility for events disproportionately to themselves, without sufficient evidence. The statement does not show black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), nor is it predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or interpreting emotions as facts (Emotional Reasoning). It also does not label a person, magnify problems, selectively filter information, read minds, overgeneralize, or use 'should' statements.",Personalization
1967,Even the closest friends are lying to me. Who else is there with me?,"""Even the closest friends are lying to me""; ""Who else is there with me?""","The statement ""Even the closest friends are lying to me"" generalizes from a situation to imply that all close friends are deceptive, without considering evidence to the contrary. This broad conclusion based on limited information indicates overgeneralization. The question ""Who else is there with me?"" reflects feelings of isolation stemming from this belief, but the core distortion is the sweeping negative conclusion about all close friends.",Overgeneralization
1968,"Maybe I need to rest and relax, try some sleeping drinks and exercise more. But I certainly can't. I always let myself down at a critical time.","""I certainly can't"", ""I always let myself down at a critical time""","The statement starts with reasonable suggestions to rest, relax, and exercise, indicating awareness of possible solutions. However, the speaker quickly concludes that they 'certainly can't' do these things, expressing a definite inability. The phrase 'I always let myself down at a critical time' generalizes the failure to all critical moments, implying a consistent and unchangeable trait. This rigid categorization without exceptions indicates overgeneralization, where a single or few instances are viewed as an unchanging pattern.",Overgeneralization
1969,The kid's growing up. Maybe I need to adjust my education.,The kid's growing up. Maybe I need to adjust my education.,"The statement observes a fact ('The kid's growing up.') and then considers a possible action ('Maybe I need to adjust my education.'). It expresses a tentative thought about future adaptation, without assuming a definite negative or positive outcome. There is no evidence of distortion types such as all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or mind reading. The use of 'Maybe' suggests openness rather than certainty. The statement is reasoning about a logical future change based on a current observation, without jumping to conclusions or making absolute statements.",No Distortion
1970,I'm the one who's so lazy. I don't deserve to be a good employee.,"""I'm the one who's so lazy"" and ""I don't deserve to be a good employee""","The speaker labels themselves in a negative and absolute way by using the term ""lazy,"" which is a general and global negative characteristic attributed to their entire self. This is beyond a specific behavior or instance and instead assigns a fixed negative label to their identity. Additionally, the statement ""I don't deserve to be a good employee"" reflects a global, enduring judgement based on this label. This matches the cognitive distortion known as Labeling, where a person assigns a negative label to themselves or others instead of recognizing specific actions or situations.",Labeling
1971,Mother sure didn't want to go out and fight. She wanted to keep me around.,"""Mother sure didn't want to go out and fight. She wanted to keep me around.""","The statement attributes specific intentions and desires to the mother without explicit evidence, assuming knowledge of her internal motives. This reflects 'mind reading,' a cognitive distortion where one believes they know what another person is thinking or feeling without confirmation.",Mind Reading
1972,Look at my pig-like body and appetite. I always feel like I'm a loser when I see someone else's perfect body.,"""pig-like body and appetite"", ""I always feel like I'm a loser"", ""when I see someone else's perfect body""","The statement includes a harsh and negative label directed at oneself ('pig-like body and appetite'), which is a derogatory term used to define the self in a global and negative way. The speaker also derives a negative self-assessment ('loser') based on comparisons with others' bodies. This use of a negative global label on oneself is characteristic of the cognitive distortion known as Labeling. Other distortions like All-or-Nothing Thinking or Emotional Reasoning are less fitting because the focus is on the negative self-label rather than polarized thinking or feeling-based conclusions.",Labeling
1973,"When they're in love, they're looking at the only one who's got a boyfriend. Where's my place?","""they're looking at the only one who's got a boyfriend"", ""Where's my place?""","The statement implies that the speaker assumes others are intentionally focusing on people who are unavailable (only the ones with boyfriends), suggesting an interpretation of others' thoughts or intentions without evidence. Additionally, the question ""Where's my place?"" reflects a feeling of exclusion or rejection based on this assumed behavior. This aligns with 'Mind Reading', where one believes they know what others are thinking or feeling without concrete proof.",Mind Reading
1974,"Next time, I'll be sure to stay out of bed.","Next time, I'll be sure to stay out of bed.","The statement uses the phrase 'I'll be sure to' which implies a rule or expectation the speaker sets for themselves about what they should do in the future. This fits with the 'Should statements' distortion, where individuals impose strict rules or standards ('should', 'must', 'have to') on themselves or others. The sentence is not predicting the future in a negative way (Fortune-telling), nor is it all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, personalization, or any other listed distortion. Instead, it reflects a resolved personal expectation or obligation.",Should statements

I know that the eternal friendship of this world is nothing but a void and that the hearts and minds are the most elusive.","""No matter how hard it is, it cannot be reversed"", ""the eternal friendship of this world is nothing but a void"", ""the hearts and minds are the most elusive""","The statement expresses a belief that friendship is inherently void and that emotions are unreachable, which is a broad, negative generalization about relationships and human nature. The phrase 'No matter how hard it is, it cannot be reversed' indicates a sense of permanence and hopelessness. This reflects a global negative conclusion drawn from limited evidence about friendships and emotional connections, characteristic of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
1976,I'm in so much pain. What do I have to do to stay out of it?,"""I'm in so much pain."" ""What do I have to do to stay out of it?""","The statement expresses a feeling of intense pain and a question about what must be done to avoid experiencing that pain. This reflects a focus on emotional experience as evidence of an uncontrollable and persistent problem. The phrase 'I'm in so much pain' represents emotional reasoning, where the person's feelings are taken as proof that the situation is unbearable or unchangeable. The question that follows shows distress about how to escape the pain, but the core distortion lies in equating feeling pain with an objective, unalterable fact, disregarding other possible explanations or perspectives.",Emotional Reasoning
1977,"I just left home a few years ago, and they died, and I can't leave anymore.","They died after I left home a few years ago, and now I can't leave anymore.","The statement shows the person connecting their leaving home with the death of significant others and concluding that they can no longer leave home. This implies an assumption that leaving home directly leads to losing loved ones, a broad conclusion based on a single event (the death occurring after they left). This is an example of overgeneralizing from one incident to a rule about their ability to leave home.",Overgeneralization
1978,"Although I have been unable to find a job for a while, I have not stopped studying, and suffering is an exercise.",Unable to find a job for a while; have not stopped studying; suffering is an exercise.,"The statement acknowledges a difficulty ('unable to find a job for a while'), but then highlights a positive action ('have not stopped studying') and reframes suffering as beneficial ('suffering is an exercise'). There is no extreme all-or-nothing perspective, no assumption about feelings reflecting reality, no predictive thinking about the future, no negative labeling, no magnification of negatives, no selective focus on negative details, no mind reading, no generalizing from one event, no taking things personally, and no use of 'should' statements. Rather, it reflects a balanced and constructive view, indicating an absence of distortion.",No Distortion

Just do your best.","The statement acknowledges variability and imperfection ('test to be up and down', 'not for everything to be paid') and encourages a balanced effort ('Just do your best'). There is no indication of extreme thinking, jumping to conclusions, or negative labeling. Instead, it reflects acceptance of reality without distortion.",No Distortion
1980,The dog followed me through the hard work of doing so much for me and so much virtue.,The dog followed me through the hard work of doing so much for me and so much virtue.,"The statement attributes the dog's following behavior to the speaker's 'hard work' and 'so much virtue', implying a direct causal relationship based on personal qualities. This reflects personalization, where the individual assumes that the dog’s behavior is directly related to their own efforts and virtues, disregarding other possible reasons for the dog's actions.",Personalization
1981,Even a stray dog on the side of the road can bully me. I'm such a badass!,"""Even a stray dog on the side of the road can bully me."" ""I'm such a badass!""","The statement implies that the speaker is bullied even by a stray dog, which is likely an exaggeration or distortion of reality. The phrase ""I'm such a badass!"" is ironic or sarcastic, pointing to a negative self-label based on this perceived weakness. This fits the pattern of ""Labeling,"" where the speaker assigns a global negative label to themselves (implying weakness or failure) based on a specific event or feeling.",Labeling
1982,"If he doesn't understand me so well, let's get a divorce, and I'll be fine.","""If he doesn't understand me so well"", ""let's get a divorce"", ""I'll be fine""","The statement presents a conditional scenario implying only two extreme outcomes: either he understands me well or we get a divorce and I am fine.

They then conclude that living together is impossible for harmony, implying a rigid, absolute view without nuance. This reflects a tendency to categorize behavior or situations in extreme terms, typical of all-or-nothing thinking. There is no indication that the speaker is merely interpreting emotions (emotional reasoning), predicting the future without evidence (fortune-telling), or assuming the other’s thoughts (mind reading). Labeling is present but the final conclusion about impossibility indicates a broader, black-and-white conclusion about the relationship dynamics. Thus, the dominant distortion is All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1985,It's a matter of urgency that I rewrite the reasons for my failure in case I ever make a mistake again.,"""It's a matter of urgency"", ""in case I ever make a mistake again"", ""rewrite the reasons for my failure""","The statement implies an urgent need to prepare for potential future mistakes by pre-writing reasons for failure. This suggests an exaggerated importance and urgency assigned to the situation, reflecting a tendency to magnify the significance of the possibility of future failure. The focus is on preventing a future negative event by overemphasizing the consequences. This aligns most closely with Magnification, as the person is blowing out of proportion the need to plan for potential failure.",Magnification
1986,"It's often felt that if I were a boy, they'd be happy to get along and find ways to love me.","""if I were a boy, they'd be happy to get along and find ways to love me""","The statement assumes the thoughts and feelings of others ('they'd be happy') based on the speaker's gender, without concrete evidence. It attributes specific intentions or reactions to others, reflecting an attempt to know what others think or feel. This matches the cognitive distortion called 'Mind Reading', where the person believes they know others' internal states without verification.",Mind Reading
1987,I don't want to take this mission. It's an experiment to kill with a knife. He's trying to make fun of me.,"""It's an experiment to kill with a knife."" ""He's trying to make fun of me.""","The phrase ""He's trying to make fun of me"" reflects the assumption or belief about another person's intent without clear evidence. This is interpreting others' thoughts or intentions, which relates to Mind Reading. The other phrase ""It's an experiment to kill with a knife"" reflects a distorted, exaggerated negative prediction (possibly fortune-telling), but the stronger, clearer distortion is mind reading as it directly involves attributing intent to someone else.",Mind Reading
1988,"Every time you want something special to eat, you don't have to come to me.","Every time you want something special to eat, you don't have to come to me.",The statement implies a generalization about all instances ('Every time') related to wanting special food and the consequence of not needing to come to the speaker. This suggests a broad and absolute conclusion based on repeated situations without considering exceptions or nuances. The person is making a sweeping generalization about the behavior.,Overgeneralization

They are attempting to infer what the other person might be thinking or feeling.",Mind Reading
1990,So I don't have it.,So I don't have it,"""So I don't have it"" is a conclusion stated without context but implies a negative deduction potentially based on limited or assumed information. It reflects a belief or conclusion about a situation without evidence or certainty, which aligns with making predictions or assumptions about the future or outcomes. This aligns closely with the distortion type 'Fortune-telling,' where an individual predicts negative outcomes or states without solid evidence.",Fortune-telling
1991,"All I need to do is go to school, get good grades, nothing else, and I don't want to do this anymore.","""All I need to do is go to school, get good grades, nothing else"" and ""I don't want to do this anymore""","The statement presents a rigid and absolute criterion for success or fulfillment ('All I need to do... nothing else'), indicating a black-and-white perspective without room for nuance. This reflects a mindset where only perfect achievement (going to school and getting good grades) matters, and any other factors or possibilities are ignored. This rigid framing is typical of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where something is seen as either completely successful or a total failure with no middle ground.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
1992,"It's not just friendship, it's not everything that's ever been in the world.","""It's not just friendship, it's not everything that's ever been in the world.""","The phrase contrasts 'friendship' with 'everything that's ever been in the world,' implying a dichotomy where if something is not 'friendship,' it must be 'everything,' an extreme either/or perspective.

I'll never be social again.,"""I can't even deal with roommates"", ""Socialization is really scary"", ""I'll never be social again""","The statement starts with a current difficulty ('I can't even deal with roommates') which is a specific issue. The claim 'Socialization is really scary' reflects an emotional response that influences the perspective. The key phrase 'I'll never be social again' predicts a permanent, unchanging future outcome based on a present problem. This prediction without evidence fits the cognitive distortion of 'Fortune-telling'. The speaker assumes they will always fail at socialization in the future, which is a classic example of fortune-telling rather than a present fact.",Fortune-telling

The phrase ""I've always fallen in endless comparisons"" indicates a consistent and recurring issue, which aligns with overgeneralization. The perception that ""they're still looking for new comparative goals"" and ""I'm always not good enough"" reflects a broad, sweeping negative conclusion about the self, despite evidence of progress (""even if I did better than before""). This indicates making a global negative judgment about oneself based on selective instances, characteristic of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

This indicates a sweeping generalization about the source of emotional support and warmth. It is not simply emotional reasoning, as the speaker is not concluding based solely on feelings, but rather making a broad generalization. It is also not all-or-nothing thinking, since it focuses more on generalizing the exclusive importance without framing it as a black-or-white failure or success. Therefore, the key distortion is overgeneralization, where a single or limited experience is seen as representative of a broader reality.",Overgeneralization

I'm afraid I was born to lose everything.,"""insurmountable gap between me and success"", ""I'm afraid I was born to lose everything""","The phrase 'insurmountable gap between me and success' indicates a belief that success is completely unattainable, reflecting a black-and-white or absolute thinking pattern. The statement 'I'm afraid I was born to lose everything' generalizes the fear of failure to all aspects of life and implies a permanent, inherent failure. This shows a tendency to overgeneralize from current feelings or situations to an all-encompassing life outcome. Considering the options, while there is an element of fear about the future (fortune-telling), the predominant distortion is the sweeping generalization about self and life circumstances indicating Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
1998,I'm sorry my dad called me. I don't know what I did wrong. Why do you call me? I don't want to go home.,"""I don't know what I did wrong"", ""Why do you call me?"", ""I don't want to go home""","The speaker expresses confusion about why their dad called, implying some fault but without evidence ('I don't know what I did wrong'). This shows an assumption of personal fault without clear reasoning. Additionally, the question 'Why do you call me?' suggests trying to infer the caller's motives without any clear knowledge, which is a form of expecting or assuming intentions. Finally, the statement 'I don't want to go home' reflects emotional distress tied to the call. The main distortion here is assuming intentions or thoughts of others without evidence, fitting the definition of 'Mind Reading.'",Mind Reading
1999,"It's been a long time since I contacted my family, and if they hadn't slept, they'd be complaining that I had ignored them.","if they hadn't slept, they'd be complaining that I had ignored them","The speaker assumes they know what their family would think or say if they were awake, without having any real evidence.

They care about their big kids, they like their big kids. They never give me a little bit of love.",The speaker assumes the parents do not love them at all and only love their siblings. This reflects a binary perspective where the speaker views parental love as something only given to others and completely withheld from them. There is a generalization from specific observations (parents loving other children) to a broad conclusion about themselves (never receiving any love). This reasoning goes beyond a single incident and applies a blanket judgment across all parental interactions.

2001,It's horrible. I'll never get pregnant again.,"""It's horrible."" and ""I'll never get pregnant again.""","The phrase ""It's horrible."" reflects an emotional evaluation of the situation, indicating the person is basing their judgment on feelings rather than objective evidence, which suggests Emotional Reasoning. The statement ""I'll never get pregnant again."" predicts a future outcome with certainty without evidence, which points to Fortune-telling. However, since the core distortion in this sentence is a negative prediction about the future with absolute certainty, it fits best with Fortune-telling rather than the general emotional evaluation or other types.",Fortune-telling

It also makes a moral judgment about children deserving their treatment. This shows a broad generalization from a specific idea to a global scope without evidence. There is no indication of constant extremes (all-or-nothing), direct emotional reasoning from feelings alone, or mind reading regarding specific thoughts. The emphasis on universal behavior matches the pattern of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2003,"He is the most cold, stone-headed man in the world.

Additionally, stating that ""He has no family, no one he cares about"" generalizes his entire social and emotional life, contributing to a negative global judgment. This is not just a single instance of negative assessment but a broad, all-encompassing characterization. While there is some overgeneralization in the description of his relationships, the primary distortion lies in the application of an extreme and negative label that defines the person's entire identity.",Labeling
2004,Why don't you give me the report? Is the hospital trying to blackmail my money?,Why don't you give me the report? Is the hospital trying to blackmail my money?,"The statement assumes the hospital has an intention (blackmail) without evidence, interpreting an unknown action (not giving the report) as a negative motive. This involves making assumptions about others' intentions or thoughts without sufficient proof.",Mind Reading
2005,Did I usually talk to my teacher too much to make her think I was trustworthy?,Did I usually talk to my teacher too much to make her think I was trustworthy?,The statement reflects the speaker's assumption about the teacher's thoughts or beliefs without direct evidence. The person is trying to infer what the teacher thinks (that the speaker is trustworthy) based on their own behavior (talking to the teacher often). This aligns with 'Mind Reading' because it involves imagining or assuming another person's mental state or thoughts.,Mind Reading

The school must have given scholarships to our honest people!,"""There must be a curtain!"" and ""The school must have given scholarships to our honest people!""","The statement uses the word ""must"" indicating rigid beliefs about how things ought to be or must be. This suggests the presence of 'should' or 'must' type thinking, where the speaker is imposing strict rules or expectations without allowance for flexibility or alternative possibilities. This aligns with 'Should statements' cognitive distortion, where someone believes things should happen in a certain way, often leading to frustration or disappointment if not met. The statement does not show evidence of predicting the future (Fortune-telling), assigning global negative labels (Labeling), predicting thoughts or feelings of others (Mind Reading), or other distortions.",Should statements
2013,"If you're late, get up to class and sleep with your alarm clock next time.","""If you're late"", ""sleep with your alarm clock next time""","The statement implies a rule about what should be done if someone is late—specifically, that they should sleep with their alarm clock next time. This prescriptive language imposes a rigid expectation or rule about behavior, which is characteristic of 'Should statements'. The phrase reflects a judgment of what is right or wrong behavior rather than an emotional or factual assessment. It does not suggest absolutes (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or reading others' minds, but rather lays out a clear 'should' rule.",Should statements
2014,"I know it's for my own good, but I'm still embarrassed.","I know it's for my own good, but I'm still embarrassed.","The statement acknowledges a logical understanding that the situation is beneficial ('it's for my own good'), yet the person feels a negative emotion ('embarrassed') despite that understanding. This reflects basing the reality or truth of a situation on emotional response rather than objective evidence. The key point is the reliance on feeling embarrassed as proof that the situation might be negative, which matches the definition of Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
2015,"Feels like there's a gap in life, really sad.","""Feels like there's a gap in life, really sad.""","The key phrase indicates the person is concluding that life has a 'gap' based primarily on their emotional state ('Feels like', 'really sad'). This suggests they are using their feelings as evidence of reality rather than objective facts, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions listed. The statement reflects interpreting reality through the filter of sadness.",Emotional Reasoning
2016,I want my parents to realize that this is not the right thing to do and to stop it.,"""I want my parents to realize"", ""this is not the right thing to do"", ""to stop it""","The statement expresses a desire for the parents to recognize the wrongness of an action and to cease it. It implies a belief about what others should do, reflecting an internal rule or expectation. This fits the 'Should statements' distortion, where rigid expectations about how others should behave cause distress. There is no evidence of assuming thoughts of others without evidence (Mind Reading), nor is there an extreme all-or-nothing viewpoint, emotional reasoning, or other distortions. The focus is on what the speaker thinks the parents should do.",Should statements

I'll be stuck in this failed marriage for the rest of my life.,"""I'm not good enough to marry someone I don't like.""; ""I'll be stuck in this failed marriage for the rest of my life.""","The first phrase reflects a self-critical and absolute judgment on personal worth, suggesting a black-and-white view of self-value tied to marriage suitability, which aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking. The second phrase predicts a lifelong negative outcome (being stuck in a failed marriage) without evidence, demonstrating a specific form of negative future prediction consistent with Fortune-telling. However, the core distortion driving the statement is the absolute, rigid assessment of self-worth and the marriage scenario, indicative of All-or-Nothing Thinking. The statement is polarized—either good enough or not, failed marriage or not—without nuance or middle ground.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2018,That man looked at me wrong. He must have found out. He must have looked at me in a way that looked at the art of behavior.,"""That man looked at me wrong"", ""He must have found out"", ""He must have looked at me in a way that looked at the art of behavior""","The statement involves assuming the man’s thoughts or intentions without any concrete evidence, specifically concluding that he must have 'found out' something and interpreting his glance as meaningful. This is an example of attributing specific thoughts or knowledge to another person without confirmation, which aligns with 'Mind Reading'. Other distortions like fortune-telling usually predict future events, which is not the case here. The statement also does not display extremes (all-or-nothing), filtering, or labeling. Therefore, the primary distortion is the assumption about another person's mental state or thoughts.",Mind Reading
2019,Are your colleagues blind? Why don't you just give me an approval? They're not good at all.,"""Are your colleagues blind?"", ""Why don't you just give me an approval?"", ""They're not good at all.""","The statement includes a judgment that the colleagues are 'blind,' implying they are incapable of seeing what the speaker thinks is obvious. The phrase 'They're not good at all' is a harsh, global negative evaluation of the colleagues without nuance. This reflects labeling, which is the cognitive distortion of assigning a negative and fixed label to others (or oneself) based on limited evidence or specific behavior. While there is emotional reasoning involved, the dominant cognitive distortion here is the use of a strong negative label ('blind' and 'not good at all') rather than balanced or specific criticism. The statement does not suggest all-or-nothing thinking (complete extremes on self or others), fortune-telling (predicting the future), mind reading (assuming knowledge of others' thoughts), or personalization (self-focused blame). It centers on derogatory labeling.",Labeling
2020,My roommate must hate me. That's why he's fighting me.,"""My roommate must hate me"" and ""he's fighting me""","The phrase ""My roommate must hate me"" represents a conclusion about the roommate's feelings without direct evidence; it assumes knowledge of another person's thoughts or emotions. This aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Mind Reading, where an individual believes they know what others are thinking or feeling without confirmation. The subsequent ""That's why he's fighting me"" links the assumption to an explanation for behavior, reinforcing the distortion. There is no indication of an all-or-nothing perspective, emotional state dictating reality, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions in this context.",Mind Reading
2021,That's what patients do. They're stupid. They think the doctors lied to him. They say it's useless.,"""They're stupid.""","The statement calls a group of people (patients) 'stupid,' which is a negative and global label applied to them. This is a clear example of labeling, where a person or group is defined by a negative trait or characteristic rather than viewing their behavior or situation in a more nuanced way.",Labeling

This is a classic example of 'Mind Reading,' where one believes they can read others' thoughts or intentions without concrete evidence. Additionally, the phrase 'I'm a stain on the family' reflects negative self-labeling, but the primary distortion driving the main assertion is mind reading about the family's feelings.",Mind Reading
2023,The boss is after me. He gives me more assignments if I don't like it. It's not fair.,"""The boss is after me"", ""He gives me more assignments if I don't like it"", ""It's not fair""","The statement ""The boss is after me"" suggests a belief that the boss has a personal vendetta without clear evidence, which indicates an assumption about others' intentions. The phrase ""He gives me more assignments if I don't like it"" implies a cause-effect relationship that may be a result of interpreting actions as targeted retaliation. This reflects the tendency to infer what others are thinking or intending without factual support. Therefore, the cognitive distortion is about assuming knowledge of another person's thoughts or motives.",Mind Reading
2024,"If I don't get a graduate, people around me would hate to laugh at me.","""If I don't get a graduate, people around me would hate to laugh at me.""","The sentence predicts a negative social outcome (people laughing and hating) based on the speaker not graduating. This is a clear example of predicting future events negatively without definite evidence, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling'. It is not about assuming others' thoughts without evidence (Mind Reading), nor about extreme all-or-nothing views or labeling. The focus is on assuming a negative consequence will occur in the future.",Fortune-telling

This involves making a prediction about a future event, which is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling'. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or other distortions here, as the speaker is neither assuming total failure nor generalizing but specifically anticipating a future outcome.",Fortune-telling
2027,"For two weeks in a row, I'm the one that nobody cares about. I'm doomed to die alone.","""For two weeks in a row, I'm the one that nobody cares about.""; ""I'm doomed to die alone.""","The statement ""For two weeks in a row, I'm the one that nobody cares about"" generalizes a specific short-term experience to a broader, ongoing condition, suggesting that because of recent events, the person believes they are universally uncared for. The phrase ""I'm doomed to die alone"" extends this belief into a negative, inevitable future outcome based on current feelings and experiences without concrete evidence. This reflects a pattern where one or two instances lead to a broad and typically negative conclusion about one's entire social worth and future, which fits the definition of Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

This use of absolute labels to define oneself fits into the cognitive distortion known as 'Labeling', where individuals assign fixed, global traits to themselves or others without nuance. Although the statement also includes some acceptance ('I'm not ashamed'), the core distortion is the application of broad, oversimplified labels to identity.",Labeling
2029,He said it was his. I wouldn't be affected. I know I'm a useful person.,"""He said it was his. I wouldn't be affected. I know I'm a useful person.""","The speaker assumes they won't be affected by the situation because the other person claimed ownership. This reflects an assumption about how things will turn out without sufficient evidence, indicating a prediction of future events. Additionally, the statement ""I know I'm a useful person"" serves as a self-assuring belief, which counters potential negative impact. The key cognitive distortion here is the prediction about the future outcome (not being affected), which aligns with Fortune-telling. There is no evidence of exaggerated all-or-nothing terms, emotional conclusions, labeling, or personalization. The focus is on expecting a specific outcome.",Fortune-telling
2030,"Everyone in my household seemed to be hostile to me, and they bullied me, and were high above me, and despised me. And I felt deeply excluded, and I hated their arrogance.

This reflects a sweeping generalization from particular experiences or feelings to all individuals in the family. The speaker also uses a metaphor ('like a pestilence') and believes no one liked them, which intensifies the negative generalization. These elements point to an overgeneralization distortion where a broad negative conclusion is drawn from a limited set of interactions or feelings.",Overgeneralization
2031,"These people are insane, insane, uncontrollable, like the beast that lets out the cages.","""These people are insane, insane, uncontrollable, like the beast that lets out the cages.""","The statement applies a very extreme and negative label to a group of people, calling them 'insane' and comparing them to uncontrollable beasts. This type of thinking categorizes individuals in a harsh, global, and overly simplified way without considering nuances or exceptions. It is not about predicting the future (fortune-telling), emotional feelings (emotional reasoning), or filtering experience through one perspective alone. Instead, it uses a demeaning global label on others, which aligns best with the cognitive distortion known as 'Labeling'.",Labeling
2032,"I've disgraced my parents, blacked out classes, and living lives are just wasting limited resources.","I've disgraced my parents, blacked out classes, living lives are just wasting limited resources","The speaker uses extreme negative language such as 'disgraced,' 'just wasting limited resources,' which reflects an absolute, extreme judgment on their actions and self-worth. This indicates a pattern of thinking in terms of extremes, without middle ground. The phrase 'just wasting limited resources' suggests an all-encompassing negative evaluation. This fits with 'All-or-Nothing Thinking,' where situations or oneself are seen as completely bad or a total failure rather than a mixture of outcomes or possibilities.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2033,"If I lose, how can I face my client? He trusts me. How can I treat him?","""If I lose, how can I face my client? He trusts me. How can I treat him?""","The speaker assumes that losing will inevitably make it impossible to face their client and that the client's trust will be damaged to the point that proper treatment cannot continue. This assumes a negative outcome as permanent and unchangeable, focusing on an assumed emotional consequence without evidence. The statement reflects an expectation of a negative future event and its emotional impact, specifically anticipating failure and its consequences before it happens.",Fortune-telling
2034,It's only when parents discipline me that I feel useful and worthy of recognition for my life.,"""It’s only when parents discipline me""; ""I feel useful and worthy of recognition for my life""","The statement suggests that the speaker's sense of usefulness and worthiness is entirely dependent on the action of their parents disciplining them. This implies a rigid, black-and-white thinking pattern where the speaker believes their value only exists under one specific condition, excluding any other possible scenarios where they could feel worthy. It reflects an 'all or nothing' perspective rather than a balanced or nuanced understanding.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2035,"I was unable to assess the commercial risks, which led to the failure of the present, and I was really powerless.","""I was unable to assess the commercial risks"", ""which led to the failure of the present"", ""I was really powerless""","The statement attributes the entire failure to the speaker's inability to assess commercial risks, implying a direct causal link between one personal failure and the overall negative outcome. The phrase ""I was really powerless"" further emphasizes a sense of helplessness and total lack of control. There is a focus on a singular reason leading to a broad failure, which extends the impact of one event to a general negative situation. This suggests a cognitive distortion where a single event or inability is magnified into the cause of complete failure without nuance or external factors considered. This matches the concept of Magnification, where the significance or consequences of an event are exaggerated.",Magnification
2036,That's how life is. I don't see any hope of getting better.,That's how life is. I don't see any hope of getting better.,"The phrase 'That's how life is' generalizes a negative perception of life as a whole, implying permanence and universality of negative circumstances. The follow-up 'I don't see any hope of getting better' reflects a belief that improvement is impossible, which implies predicting a negative future without evidence. This indicates a cognitive distortion involving generalizing a negative scenario to all situations and time. Among the listed types, this aligns with Overgeneralization, where one takes a single or limited event(s) and applies it too broadly as a permanent state.",Overgeneralization

Why does it always happen to me?","""I'm used to it."", ""Every time I want to do something, I get all kinds of obstacles."", ""Why does it always happen to me?""","The statement generalizes a recurring negative experience by saying 'every time' and 'always,' implying that obstacles occur in all situations without exception. This broad generalization from specific events to an overarching pattern fits the distortion of overgeneralization. There is no indication of all-or-nothing extremes, emotional reasoning based solely on feelings, fortune-telling about the future, labeling oneself or others, magnifying the importance of events beyond proportion, filtering out positives, mind reading, or applying should statements. Personalization could be considered because of 'Why does it always happen to me?,' but the key distortion remains the sweeping generalization over time.",Overgeneralization
2038,"I yearn for an undisturbed life, but no one really contacted me and I was so lonely.","""no one really contacted me"" and ""I was so lonely""","The statement implies that because the person was not contacted by anyone, they must be lonely. This reflects an assumption about others' thoughts or intentions without evidence, suggesting the person believes they are being ignored or unloved. This fits the definition of Mind Reading, where one presumes to know what others think or feel.",Mind Reading
2039,"I've been looking forward to that company, but I didn't get through the interview, and it seems I still need to upgrade my interviewing skills.",didn't get through the interview; I still need to upgrade my interviewing skills,"The statement focuses on a single failure (not passing the interview) and immediately concludes a personal deficiency (needing to upgrade interview skills). The individual attributes the failure to a personal flaw without considering other possible factors (such as the competitiveness of the position or external circumstances). This is a generalized conclusion about self-worth or capability based on one event, which aligns with overgeneralization. It is not all-or-nothing thinking because the statement is not absolute, not emotional reasoning as it is not driven solely by feelings, nor is it fortune-telling or mind reading because it does not predict the future or assume others' thoughts. There are no should statements or labeling. Therefore, overgeneralization fits best.",Overgeneralization
2040,I don't even like boys like me. I don't like boys like me. I just end up alone.,"""I don't even like boys like me. I don't like boys like me. I just end up alone.""","The statement generalizes the speaker's feelings towards a broad category ('boys like me') and then extends that sentiment to a definitive outcome ('I just end up alone'). This indicates the person is making a broad generalization about their social or romantic prospects based on limited experiences or feelings, suggesting a pattern of concluding that they will always be alone. There is no indication of absolute thinking (all-or-nothing), nor is there evidence of thoughts based on emotions alone (emotional reasoning). The statement does not predict a specific future outcome with certainty beyond the expressed overgeneralization, so it fits best with the distortion known as Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2041,I'm sure the teacher has noticed my incompetence.,I'm sure the teacher has noticed my incompetence,"The phrase 'I'm sure the teacher has noticed my incompetence' reflects the speaker's assumption about what the teacher is thinking without any concrete evidence. The speaker is predicting or assuming the teacher's perspective, effectively 'reading the teacher's mind.' This aligns with the distortion type 'Mind Reading,' which involves assuming knowledge of others' thoughts or feelings without confirmation.",Mind Reading
2042,She must have done it on purpose! She just wanted me to be ugly in front of all my classmates!,"""She must have done it on purpose! She just wanted me to be ugly in front of all my classmates!""","The statement assumes the other person's intention without concrete evidence, presuming negative motives ('She must have done it on purpose').

If I refuse, it could lead to a breakdown in our relationship.","""He always invites me at times like this."" and ""If I refuse, it could lead to a breakdown in our relationship.""","The phrase ""He always invites me at times like this"" indicates a generalization based on past experiences, extending the pattern to all similar situations. The concern that refusing might lead to a relationship breakdown reflects an assumption about a negative outcome without evidence. This matches overgeneralization, where one applies a single experience broadly and predicts extreme consequences.",Overgeneralization

It also includes the belief that 'it's normal to have someone with me,' which indicates an expectation or rule about how things should be due to the situation. This reflects a 'should statement' cognitive distortion where the person imposes a necessity (should have someone with me) based on their condition and environment.",Should statements
2045,"It's not easy to pull her up and run away when she's grown up, there's no such thing as a mother!","""there's no such thing as a mother""","The statement ""there's no such thing as a mother"" is a sweeping conclusion that denies the existence or role of mothers entirely, likely based on a personal negative experience. This illustrates taking a specific instance or feeling and generalizing it to all cases, which is characteristic of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2046,I can't finish my report. I can't make it. My life is meaningless.,"""I can't finish my report"", ""I can't make it"", ""My life is meaningless""","The statement begins with a concrete difficulty ""I can't finish my report"" and escalates to a broad and absolute negative conclusion ""My life is meaningless"". This shows the pattern of taking one failure or problem and extending it to a total and generalized negative judgment about the self and life. This kind of sweeping negative generalization from a single event or situation fits the definition of Overgeneralization more than the other distortions. It is not All-or-Nothing Thinking because the statements are not framed in strictly black/white terms about success/failure only, but rather an expansive negative conclusion. It is not Emotional Reasoning because the statement is not solely based on a feeling but on an event. It is not Fortune-telling or Mind Reading as it does not claim to predict or assume others’ thoughts. It is not Labeling because the statement ""My life is meaningless"" is a broader life judgment and not a static label on oneself. Therefore, Overgeneralization best captures this distortion.",Overgeneralization

This reflects an extreme and absolute view of the situation without considering any middle ground or exceptions. This is indicative of 'All-or-Nothing Thinking,' as the person is seeing their circumstance in black-and-white terms, rather than a nuanced or balanced perspective.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

I'm sure I can't do anything in my life.,"""You can't do anything with that kind of salary."" and ""I'm sure I can't do anything in my life.""","The first phrase focuses on a specific limitation (salary) and concludes negatively about the ability to achieve anything. The second phrase generalizes this limitation to all aspects of life, implying a sweeping negative conclusion ('can't do anything in my life'). This broad generalization based on a single negative aspect is characteristic of overgeneralization, where one negative event or condition is taken to represent an absolute state.",Overgeneralization
2051,He probably didn't hear it.,"""He probably didn't hear it.""","The statement assumes knowledge of what another person is thinking or perceiving without direct evidence.

The phrase ""we should communicate"" contains a 'should' statement, expressing an expectation or belief about necessary behavior. The rest of the statement avoids extreme judgments and accommodates differences without negative bias. Therefore, the only potential cognitive distortion present is the use of 'should' statements.",Should statements
2053,"Lately, luck had been too bad, not only to lose the game, but also to be caught by the teacher.","Lately, luck had been too bad; not only to lose the game, but also to be caught by the teacher.","The statement focuses on the belief that 'luck had been too bad' leading to multiple negative events. This implies a prediction or expectation that bad outcomes will continue based on recent experience. The speaker is anticipating future misfortune or attributing current failures to bad luck, which reflects a negative prediction without evidence. The cognitive distortion here is making a negative forecast about what will happen next, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling.'",Fortune-telling

These thoughts reflect an overall negative self-label rather than a specific situation or behavior. The phrase 'no matter how hard I try' suggests a pervasive conclusion affecting the person's entire self-worth rather than isolated events. This is a classic example of labeling, where the individual attaches a negative global label to themselves. Other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking focus on extremes but don't necessarily involve assigning a global identity, and overgeneralization usually involves drawing broad conclusions from single events. Therefore, labeling fits best.",Labeling

The phrase ""I don't need to be with people"" suggests a definite and absolute conclusion about social interaction. This reflects an extreme, black-and-white perspective rather than a balanced or nuanced view. This pattern aligns most closely with All-or-Nothing Thinking, where things are perceived in absolute terms as either all good or all bad, with no middle ground.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2056,I must be terminally ill. My life is over.,"""I must be terminally ill"", ""My life is over""","The speaker concludes with certainty that they are terminally ill without evidence, which indicates predicting a negative outcome about the future. The phrase ""My life is over"" exaggerates the consequences of the assumed illness, indicating a negative forecast. This fits the definition of Fortune-telling, where one predicts negative outcomes without solid evidence. It is not All-or-Nothing Thinking, as the statement is more about predicting a future negative state rather than categorizing present situations as black or white. It is also not Emotional Reasoning (assuming something is true because of how one feels), Labelling (assigning a global negative label), or Magnification (exaggerating based on facts). Therefore, the best fit is Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
2057,"Ever since I was a kid, someone who wanted to compete with me is someone who wanted to make people want to compete.","""someone who wanted to compete with me"" is equated with ""someone who wanted to make people want to compete""","The statement takes the specific behavior of an individual (wanting to compete with the speaker) and extrapolates it to a broader, more generalized motive (wanting to make people want to compete). This suggests that the speaker is applying a broad conclusion about others’ intentions based on limited evidence. The phrase ""Ever since I was a kid"" also indicates this belief is applied across many situations, which supports a pattern of broad generalization.",Overgeneralization
2058,I can only feel alive if the children listen to me.,"""I can only feel alive if the children listen to me.""","The statement implies that the speaker's sense of feeling alive is completely dependent on one specific external condition—children listening to them. This indicates an all-or-nothing perspective, where the speaker believes that without this condition, they cannot feel alive at all. It reflects a black-and-white thinking pattern rather than a nuanced or balanced view. This is characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking, as opposed to distortions like Emotional Reasoning or Mind Reading, which involve interpreting feelings or others' thoughts respectively.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2059,"Am I right in this case?

2060,"It is common for children to fall in love with men, and it needs to melt their psychological barriers and be accepted slowly.",It is common for children to fall in love with men; it needs to melt their psychological barriers and be accepted slowly.,"The statement generalizes a broad behavior ('children falling in love with men') as a common occurrence and implies a universal psychological process related to acceptance and overcoming barriers without providing evidence. This shows a pattern of applying one observed or assumed case to a whole group or situation. The statement does not reflect absolute extremes (All-or-Nothing), emotional justification (Emotional Reasoning), or prediction of the future (Fortune-telling). It also does not label a person or apply should statements. Therefore, the best fit is Overgeneralization, as it extrapolates a commonality from specific or limited observations.",Overgeneralization

I don't do anything.","""It's like you don't trust me if you care about me."", ""Yeah, I'm a fool."", ""I don't do anything.""","The speaker interprets the other person's lack of trust as a lack of care, which reflects an assumption about the other's thoughts or feelings without explicit evidence—this fits 'Mind Reading.' Additionally, calling themselves a 'fool' is labeling, but the core distortion leading to the negative self-view originates from the assumed thoughts of the other person. The statement ""I don't do anything"" is a broad negative generalization about self-behavior, indicating Overgeneralization. However, the prompt asks for a single label. The most foundational distortion here is 'Mind Reading' because the speaker assumes the other's motives or beliefs ('you don't trust me if you care about me') without confirmation. The negative self-labeling and generalization stem from this assumed interpretation.",Mind Reading

Nothing good will ever happen to me.","'I'm sure I've been lined up for leadership this time', 'I'm on the edge', 'Nothing good will ever happen to me'","The phrase 'I'm sure I've been lined up for leadership this time' reflects a prediction about the future without evidence, which is indicative of fortune-telling. The statement 'Nothing good will ever happen to me' further generalizes this negative future expectation to all time, also supporting fortune-telling as it anticipates a negative outcome. The use of 'sure' highlights an assumed certainty about future events that cannot be known. Although elements of overgeneralization ('Nothing good will ever happen to me') are present, the primary distortion is the unwarranted negative prediction about the future.",Fortune-telling

This phrase implies a rigid standard or expectation that problems must not occur. Additionally, the follow-up justification about advanced medical technology supports this expectation. This characteristic aligns directly with the 'Should statements' distortion, where someone places unreasonable demands or expectations on reality. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, emotional reasoning, or other distortions here, only a rigid 'should' expectation.",Should statements

It does not generalize, label, or exaggerate. The core thought is based on perceived evidence of love, leading to a feeling of being touched. There is no evidence of distortion such as all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or mind reading beyond reasonable interpretation of love and concern. Rather, the statement aligns with how the person feels based on their perception, without illogical conclusions.",No Distortion

This is a prediction about others' thoughts and feelings without evidence, which aligns directly with mind reading. The speaker believes people will think negatively about them and will laugh at them, which involves assuming the mental states of others. It is not fortune-telling as it focuses on others' thoughts rather than future events; it is not labeling because the speaker is reporting assumed judgments, not assigning an internal label to themselves; it is not emotional reasoning since the conclusion is about others’ perceptions, not their own feelings; nor does it fit other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking or magnification.",Mind Reading

They attribute the unfairness of the world to this event, which suggests they are making a broad negative judgment about the world based on this one event. This aligns with an emotional response coloring their perception (emotional reasoning) and also generalizing the event to the entire world (overgeneralization). However, the core distortion is that the speaker is concluding the world is unfair because of their emotional pain, which fits Emotional Reasoning best.",Emotional Reasoning

""He doesn't want to look at me more"" implies assuming what another person thinks or feels without direct evidence, which correlates with mind reading. The phrase ""I'm a pain in the ass"" is a negative label applied to oneself. Combining these, the most prominent distortion involves labeling, as the speaker is negatively categorizing themselves based on their perceived flaws and assumed rejection.",Labeling

The use of 'disgusting' as an absolute negative label on this scenario indicates a harsh evaluation or naming of the situation with a very negative term. This matches the pattern of Labeling, where a person or situation is assigned a global negative label based on specific behavior or circumstance. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking (black and white), emotional reasoning based purely on feelings, or fortune-telling. The core distortion at play is assigning a disparaging label to the event.",Labeling

This reflects taking personal responsibility or blame for something that may be outside one's control. The key distortion is assigning personal fault for others' attitudes, which aligns with Personalization. It is not Mind Reading because the speaker does not only assume the parents' thoughts, but ties it to a personal lack. It is not Overgeneralization or All-or-Nothing because the statement is about causation of dislike rather than broad conclusions or extremes. Emotional Reasoning is not the primary distortion here, and the belief is more about cause and effect from self to parents' feelings.",Personalization

The phrase ""What's the point of my life?"" shows an emotional conclusion that life is meaningless based on the perceived lack of repayment. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the speaker equates their feelings of being unrewarded or frustrated with an absolute truth about the worth or meaning of their life.",Emotional Reasoning
2088,It's just that I'm so self-righteous that I'm a piece of shit that I can't do anything.,I'm so self-righteous that I'm a piece of shit that I can't do anything,"The statement features a negative global label directed at the self, calling oneself a 'piece of shit.' This is a classic example of labeling, where a person assigns themselves a highly negative and fixed trait based on situations or feelings. Although there is an element of overgeneralization ('I can't do anything'), the dominant cognitive distortion is the harsh and global negative label that encapsulates self-worth.",Labeling

Everyone thinks I'm not happy.,"""No one's gonna like me anymore""; ""Everyone thinks I'm not happy""","The statement includes the phrase ""No one's gonna like me anymore,"" which implies a prediction about the future without evidence. Similarly, ""Everyone thinks I'm not happy"" indicates assuming knowledge about others' thoughts without confirmation. These features align with the cognitive distortion of Fortune-telling (predicting negative future events without justification) and Mind Reading (assuming others' thoughts). However, since the statement emphasizes a future negative outcome (no one will like me anymore), Fortune-telling is the more dominant distortion here.",Fortune-telling
2091,I can't even feed a dog. I'm really a loser.,"""I can't even feed a dog"" and ""I'm really a loser.""","The first part of the statement, ""I can't even feed a dog,"" suggests a specific failure or inadequacy. The second part, ""I'm really a loser,"" generalizes this single incident to define the speaker's entire self-worth. This is characteristic of Overgeneralization, where one instance or event is taken as evidence of a broad, negative self-concept. Although ""I'm really a loser"" is a label, it stems directly from generalizing the initial perceived failure, fitting Overgeneralization more precisely than mere Labeling. There is no evidence of All-or-Nothing Thinking, Emotional Reasoning, or other distortions listed that match better.",Overgeneralization

This is characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where situations are viewed in extremes — either completely positive or completely negative. The speaker dismisses any possibility of learning in the current environment and generalizes the impact of the other person’s behavior as completely ruining their life, implying an all-or-nothing worldview.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This reflects Emotional Reasoning, which occurs when someone assumes that their negative emotions directly represent objective reality. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking (no absolute extremes), no fortune-telling (no specific predictions about the future), no labeling (no applying a global negative label), or other distortions primarily. The speaker's conclusion about their mental state worsening is drawn from their felt experience rather than objective evidence, fitting Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
2095,"It's okay to steal a bite, just get some more exercise tomorrow.","""It's okay to steal a bite"", ""just get some more exercise tomorrow""","The statement justifies an action that is generally perceived as negative (stealing a bite of food) by suggesting that future behavior (exercising more) will compensate for it. This reflects a 'Should statement' pattern, where the person imposes a rule or standard on themselves about behavior that must be balanced out or corrected (i.e., 'I should exercise more to make up for this'). Although it rationalizes a behavior, it primarily involves an internal directive of how one 'should' act to offset the perceived mistake.",Should statements

""I don't have to ignore them if I'm rich.""","The statement reflects a negative self-assessment focused on inability to make money, implying personal failure and a limitation. The phrase ""I can't even make money"" generalizes a specific difficulty into a broad personal deficiency. Also, there is a conditional expectation that being rich would solve the problem of ignoring the kids, implying a rigid standard or expectation that wealth is necessary to provide attention. However, the dominant cognitive distortion here is the overgeneralization where one specific perceived shortcoming ('can't make money') is extrapolated as a global failure or negative identity.",Overgeneralization
2097,"I may be even, but my wisdom and hard work will give me a long-term light, because beauty will eventually fade away and only wisdom will last forever.",beauty will eventually fade away and only wisdom will last forever,"The statement expresses a belief that beauty is transient and will fade away while wisdom and hard work provide lasting value. This is a form of generalizing one temporary condition (beauty fading) to an absolute, timeless rule about what truly matters (only wisdom lasting forever). The phrase 'only wisdom will last forever' indicates an overgeneralization by turning a specific observation into a broad, absolute conclusion.",Overgeneralization

2099,I'm an irrelevant person. I shouldn't exist.,"""I'm an irrelevant person"", ""I shouldn't exist""","The phrase ""I'm an irrelevant person"" assigns a global, negative label to the self, which is a hallmark of Labeling. The phrase ""I shouldn't exist"" uses 'should' to impose strict and unrealistic demands on existence, characteristic of Should statements. However, Labeling involves the core negative self-assessment ('irrelevant person'), whereas Should statements relate more to rules or expectations. Since the primary negative cognition is self-labeling as 'irrelevant', Labeling best captures the main distortion here.",Labeling

The use of absolute terms like ""can't"" and the generalization that ""my life is a mess"" indicate a global, all-encompassing judgment rather than a nuanced or situational assessment. This is characteristic of Overgeneralization, where the individual takes one or a few negative experiences and broadens them to define their entire life or self.",Overgeneralization

I don't want this mother.,"""Mom's so old."", ""She's still trying to keep me locked up."", ""I don't want this mother.""","The speaker makes a negative global statement about the mother by labeling her primarily by her age ('Mom's so old'). This is a clear use of a label that defines the person negatively and broadly based on a single characteristic or behavior. Additionally, the statement ""She's still trying to keep me locked up"" suggests attributing restrictive intent without evidence, but the dominant distortion is the negative labeling of the mother. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or other distortions as strongly as labeling here.",Labeling

The phrase 'I'm sure' indicates the person is making a definitive negative judgment about themselves. This is indicative of labeling, where a global negative label is applied to oneself based on a particular situation or observation. It is not about predicting the future (fortune-telling), nor is it treating issues in all-or-nothing terms or others. Emotional reasoning or overgeneralization do not directly apply here as the focus is on attaching a negative global label to self.",Labeling

This links the external situation (relationship difficulties) to internal flaws excessively. There is a clear personalization, where the speaker blames their own traits instead of considering other factors. Thus, the main distortion is 'Personalization'.",Personalization

The speaker also negatively compares themselves to classmates who have found jobs, emphasizing high-paying positions. This reflects a negative overgeneralization where a few rejections lead to a global negative perception of their job prospects and situation. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing extremes, emotional reasoning, or fortune-telling about the future here.

The addition 'my career will be over' shows a drastic, black-and-white perspective with no middle ground or possibility of recovery, which points to all-or-nothing thinking. Combining these, the dominant distortion is all-or-nothing thinking because the statement presents an extreme outcome (career completely over) without acknowledging any nuance or intermediate outcomes.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2115,She's a better roommate than me. She's been mad at me lately. She must have looked down on me. She must hate me.,"""She must have looked down on me. She must hate me.""",The speaker assumes what the other person is thinking or feeling without any clear evidence. They jump to conclusions about the roommate's thoughts and emotions based solely on her behavior.

There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or any cognitive distortion type listed. The approach is realistic and problem-solving oriented.",No Distortion
2117,"I need to make some adjustments to my pressure, and I know it's good for me to relax properly.","I need to make some adjustments to my pressure, and I know it's good for me to relax properly.","The statement reflects a rational awareness of the need to adjust pressure and the benefits of relaxing.

This conclusion generalizes from one event to all possible future occurrences, assuming no chance of future love based on present loss. This reflects an overgeneralization, where a single negative event is taken as evidence that a negative pattern will continue indefinitely.",Overgeneralization

The phrase ""I don't know who else is bothering him"" indicates an assumption about others' actions without confirmation, and ""It's better for a man like that to put a tape on his mouth"" is a harsh label applied to the person. This aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Labeling, where an individual is defined in a negative, often simplistic and overly critical way.",Labeling
2123,My family doesn't contact me. They've been busy lately.,My family doesn't contact me. They've been busy lately.,"The statement indicates a conclusion that 'My family doesn't contact me,' which may imply a belief about their behavior or feelings without concrete evidence. The addition, 'They've been busy lately,' suggests an explanation but does not confirm the intent or thoughts of the family members.

2124,The pain of life will never end when you wake up again and you worry about tomorrow's work.,"""The pain of life will never end""; ""when you wake up again and you worry about tomorrow's work""","The statement predicts a negative, unchanging future outcome ('will never end') based on current feelings of pain and worry. This involves anticipating future events negatively without concrete evidence, which aligns with predicting an unfortunate outcome ('the pain will never end').

I might be able to take a little more initiative so that we can have a better room atmosphere.,"The statement acknowledges an existing positive relationship and suggests a possibility of taking more initiative to improve the situation. There are no absolute terms (e.g., all or nothing), no negative labels, no assumptions about others' thoughts or emotions, no catastrophizing or magnifying problems, and no overly generalized statements about the situation. The speaker is considering a potential action constructively without distorted thinking patterns. Therefore, the statement reflects balanced and realistic thinking without cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

This company's a piece of shit.,"""It's too inefficient"", ""The maintenance man hasn't seen his shadow for so long"", ""This company's a piece of shit.""","The statement starts by declaring the company 'too inefficient,' which is a negative assessment. The phrase 'The maintenance man hasn't seen his shadow for so long' is a contextual reason supporting the complaint, likely indicating prolonged neglect or poor maintenance. The final phrase 'This company's a piece of shit' is a harsh, derogatory label placed on the company as a whole, reflecting a global negative judgment rather than a specific issue. This reflects the cognitive distortion of Labeling, where a person assigns a negative global label to themselves or others based on specific incidents or traits.",Labeling

Additionally, the speaker believes they can see others' judgmental thoughts and emotions (laughing eyes of relatives and friends) without confirmation, which aligns with mind reading. However, since the main focus is on predicting a negative future outcome ('How can he ever take care of me?'), this aligns most closely with Fortune-telling. The perception of others' opinions, while present, supports the main distortion but is secondary.",Fortune-telling

The phrase ""I don't have anything"" and ""I can't give anything"" suggest an absolute, black-and-white view without any middle ground or exceptions. The expression ""I have to get nabbed every day"" generalizes the experience to every single day, without acknowledging variability or exceptions. This is indicative of Overgeneralization, where a negative experience is generalized to all situations or times. There is also an emotional emphasis, but the key cognitive distortion is the broad, absolute application of these negative experiences to the entire context of the home environment. Other distortions such as Emotional Reasoning or Magnification may be present but are secondary to the overgeneralization reflected.",Overgeneralization

The statement involves anticipating an unlimited chain of negative consequences, reflecting an unfounded negative forecast.",Fortune-telling
2134,"How about those who learn to feel happy again? If they don't feel positive, my life will be meaningless.","If they don't feel positive, my life will be meaningless.","The statement links one's own life meaning directly to others feeling positive again, indicating a conditional and absolute thinking pattern. It assumes that unless others feel happy, the speaker's life automatically lacks meaning, which reflects an all-or-nothing perspective without recognizing any middle ground or alternative outcomes.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The speaker does not see the pain as unbearable, which means they are not catastrophizing or magnifying the pain. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or labeling. Instead, the speaker is interpreting their emotional state realistically and does not make unwarranted assumptions or overgeneralizations. The statement reflects a balanced and factual description rather than a cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

I'm going to be annoying.,"""I'm going to stop talking"", ""I'm going to be wrong"", ""I'm going to be annoying""","The speaker predicts negative outcomes about their future actions without concrete evidence. They assume they will be wrong and annoying just by engaging in conversation. This aligns with making unfounded predictions about negative events, which fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling'. The statement does not involve complete black-and-white thinking, labeling, or solely emotional reasoning, but rather an anticipatory negative forecast.",Fortune-telling
2137,I'm sure no one's coming after this. That's my life.,"""I'm sure no one's coming after this."" ""That's my life.""","The statement expresses a confident prediction about the future without any evident basis or evidence. The phrase 'I'm sure no one's coming after this' indicates a negative expectation about what will happen next, which aligns with predicting a negative outcome without certainty. This matches the definition of Fortune-telling, where someone assumes they know what will happen in the future, typically negatively. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking (no extremes), labeling (no assigning a fixed label), mind reading (inferring others' thoughts), or emotional reasoning (using feelings as facts). It is not an overgeneralization or personalization either.",Fortune-telling

The speaker assumes a specific, negative scenario will definitely occur in the future without evidence, which aligns with predicting an unfavorable outcome. This fits the cognitive distortion of 'Fortune-telling' where the person assumes they can foresee the future negatively.",Fortune-telling

I know that.","""I hate this month"", ""I hate a month"", ""Living is stupid""","The speaker expresses strong negative feelings about the entire month and about living in general, using absolute terms like ""hate"" and ""stupid."" This reflects a black-and-white view without middle ground or nuance, suggesting an all-or-nothing perspective. The statement ""I hate this month"" followed by ""I hate a month"" and the generalization ""Living is stupid"" indicates a sweeping negative judgment applied categorically.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

I was just a useless production tool.","""my world was dark"", ""I was just a useless production tool""","The phrase ""my world was dark"" indicates a strong emotional state that the speaker links directly to an event (getting pregnant). This suggests they are using their negative feelings as evidence about the reality of their situation. Also, the phrase ""I was just a useless production tool"" is a harsh, generalized negative label they apply to themselves based on the pregnancy. This is an example of labeling, where a negative event or feeling leads someone to assign a global, negative label to themselves.",Labeling

This is a form of labeling, where the speaker assigns a global negative label ('failed child') to themselves based on a specific behavior or condition. There is also an implicit all-or-nothing aspect, but the explicit assignment of a negative label based on one condition is most prominent. Other distortions like emotional reasoning or fortune-telling are less applicable because the focus is on self-judgment rather than feelings or predictions.",Labeling
2142,"Why do they always expect so much from me, even though I'm just a piece of shit?","""I'm just a piece of shit""","The phrase ""I'm just a piece of shit"" is a negative and global label that the speaker assigns to themselves. This reflects the distortion known as Labeling, where a person reduces themselves or others to a single, negative identity or characteristic. The statement generalizes the speaker's entire self-worth based on perceived shortcomings, rather than evaluating specific behaviors or situations.",Labeling

They're now a time bomb in society.""","The statement predicts a sequence of negative events escalating from backsliding to breakups and ultimately labeling kids as a ""time bomb"" for society. This shows the speaker is making a negative prediction about the future without concrete evidence, assuming that one negative event will inevitably lead to worse consequences. This aligns closely with 'Fortune-telling', where someone assumes they can know what the future holds and expects negative outcomes. Although there is some element of labeling (calling kids a 'time bomb'), the primary distortion focuses on predicting negative future events.",Fortune-telling
2144,I can't decide about homosexuality. I'm not the only one in the world.,"""I can't decide about homosexuality"" and ""I'm not the only one in the world.""","The first phrase expresses uncertainty or inability to make a decision, which is neutral by itself. The second phrase suggests that the speaker is normalizing their indecision by pointing out that others share the same experience. This indicates the speaker is generalizing their personal experience to a wider population. It is not an all-or-nothing statement, emotional reasoning, or fortune telling. The focus is on extending a personal state to many others, which aligns with overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2145,I've offended him before. But I'll never do that again.,"""I've offended him before"", ""But I'll never do that again.""","The phrase ""I've offended him before"" acknowledges a past event without distorting it, but the statement ""I'll never do that again"" suggests a definitive prediction about the future behavior without evidence. This is a clear example of predicting a future outcome based on current intentions or desires rather than facts. The speaker assumes absolute certainty about their future behavior, which aligns with the distortion of predicting future events without certainty.",Fortune-telling
2146,Height is only external and does not affect the beauty of a person ' s heart and does not have to dwell on things that cannot be changed.,Height is only external; does not affect the beauty of a person's heart; does not have to dwell on things that cannot be changed.,"The statement acknowledges that height is purely an external attribute and separates it from internal qualities like the beauty of one's heart. It also includes the recognition that one should not focus on unchangeable factors. There is no evidence of distorted thinking such as exaggeration, all-or-nothing perspectives, or labeling. Instead, the statement reflects a balanced and realistic viewpoint about accepting uncontrollable traits.",No Distortion
2147,"Since there's no hotel here, go home and eat. It's not that bad.","Since there's no hotel here, go home and eat. It's not that bad.","The statement takes the fact that there is no hotel and concludes that the only option is to go home and eat, followed by minimizing the negative impact with 'It's not that bad.' This shows a form of rationalizing the situation and downplaying potential disappointment. It does not involve extremes (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future beyond the immediate observation (Fortune-telling), or attributing personal fault (Personalization). Instead, it is reframing the situation and reducing its negative impact, which indicates an absence of distortion rather than a distortion. The speaker accepts the lack of hotel and suggests a reasonable alternative without exaggeration or emotional misinterpretation.",No Distortion
2148,I'm really disappointed in him. I'd rather not teach him anymore than so much.,"""I'm really disappointed in him"", ""I'd rather not teach him anymore than so much""","The speaker expresses disappointment in a specific individual and concludes that they no longer want to continue teaching him. This indicates a negative judgment about the person based on the perceived failure or issue. The phrase ""really disappointed in him"" shows a direct emotional reaction, but the key phrase ""I'd rather not teach him anymore"" suggests a harsh conclusion about the person’s worthiness or capability. This reflects a tendency to make a broad judgment about the person rather than focusing on specific behaviors or incidents, which aligns with the concept of label-based distortion.",Labeling

I want to run home right away.","""people must be laughing at me"", ""It's embarrassing"", ""I want to run home right away""","The statement assumes that others are laughing at the speaker without concrete evidence, which reflects thinking that attributes negative thoughts or feelings to others without proof. This aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Mind Reading, where one presumes to know what others are thinking or feeling. The embarrassment and desire to run away are emotional responses supporting this mistaken assumption.",Mind Reading
2150,"If he wants to fight me, I will break with him and destroy everything.","""If he wants to fight me"", ""I will break with him and destroy everything""","The statement predicts a future outcome based on the condition of the other person wanting to fight. The speaker assumes a certain scenario will definitely happen without evidence that it will. This is a form of predicting the future negatively (the fight leading to total destruction) rather than considering multiple possible outcomes. Thus, the distortion involves assuming what will happen without proof or certainty.",Fortune-telling
2151,Zhang has ruined my mood for a day. Why don't you sit down?,"""Zhang has ruined my mood for a day.""","The statement suggests that Zhang's actions have caused a sustained negative mood lasting an entire day. This implies an exaggeration of the negative impact of a single event, which fits the pattern of magnification. It is an overemphasis on the negative effect that amplifies the emotional reaction.",Magnification
2152,Maybe I did something bad.,"""Maybe I did something bad.""","The statement involves uncertainty about having done something bad without clear evidence. It reflects a tentative assumption about future or unknown outcomes based on incomplete information, which aligns closely with predicting or anticipating something negative without certainty. This fits with 'Fortune-telling,' where one expects or believes they have done something wrong despite not knowing for sure.",Fortune-telling
2153,I don't even have a home. My life will never be better.,"""I don't even have a home.""; ""My life will never be better.""","The first phrase expresses a current negative fact, indicating a perceived lack or deprivation. The second phrase is a prediction about the future that is absolute and negative. This is an example of assuming that things will always remain bad with no possibility of improvement, hence making a broad negative prediction without evidence. This aligns with 'Fortune-telling', which involves predicting a negative future outcome. It could also suggest 'Overgeneralization' since a current hardship is extended to a permanent life condition, but the emphasis on a future prediction ('will never be better') points more to 'Fortune-telling'.",Fortune-telling

I'm sure I can win it back.,"The speaker believes they should continue because they are convinced that their luck has wrongly run out and that persistence will reverse their misfortune. This reflects an irrational prediction about future events without sufficient evidence. The expectation that they will regain their luck and win back losses is an attempt to predict a positive outcome despite current negative evidence. This fits the cognitive distortion where one predicts future events, usually negatively or unrealistically, without factual basis.",Fortune-telling
2155,He doesn't deserve to be his child if he doesn't learn.,He doesn't deserve to be his child if he doesn't learn.,"The statement implies a rigid, black-and-white condition where the father 'deserves' his child only if the child learns. This reflects an absolute, all-or-nothing perspective without any middle ground or nuance. It does not reflect emotional assumptions (emotional reasoning), prediction of the future (fortune-telling), negative labeling, or other distortions listed. The phrase 'doesn't deserve' highlights a conditional judgment that aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2156,My cake shop is in bad shape. I can't make money. I can't live.,"""My cake shop is in bad shape. I can't make money. I can't live.""","The statement expresses a series of negative conclusions based on the current situation of the cake shop: it is 'in bad shape,' the speaker 'can't make money,' and as a result, claims 'I can't live.' The phrase 'I can't live' is an extreme conclusion likely derived from financial difficulty. This reflects a tendency to view the situation in black-and-white terms with no middle ground or potential for improvement, which fits the pattern of All-or-Nothing Thinking. There is a sweeping negative view with no acknowledgment of possible alternatives or partial successes. The final conclusion about not being able to live is an example of catastrophizing combined with absolute thinking, but All-or-Nothing Thinking best captures the core distortion here.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2157,It's so embarrassing. I'm such a bad face that people hate.,"""I'm such a bad face that people hate""","The statement involves assigning a negative global label to oneself ('bad face') and attributing a negative evaluation from others ('people hate'). This reflects a tendency to define oneself in an absolute, negative way rather than considering specific behaviors or context. The phrase 'such a bad face' generalizes a perceived flaw into a definitive, all-encompassing characteristic, which aligns with labeling. Although there is an element of mind reading ('people hate'), the core distortion is the negative self-labeling.",Labeling

They believe that because of these failures, they will 'never get anywhere in my life' and will be 'despised by my family and friends.'

2162,Everyone hates me. Even a stray dog comes to bully me.,"""Everyone hates me"", ""Even a stray dog comes to bully me""","The statement ""Everyone hates me"" indicates a generalization from personal experience to all people, assuming universally negative judgment without evidence. The phrase ""Even a stray dog comes to bully me"" exaggerates the negative perception and supports the broad generalization. There is no direct evidence of predicting future events (Fortune-telling), interpreting emotions as facts (Emotional Reasoning), or demanding certain behaviors (Should statements). The distortion lies primarily in making a sweeping negative conclusion about all others based on limited experience, characteristic of Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

This is an instance of 'Labeling' because they are assigning a negative label to their entire self based on how they feel or perceive a situation. The statements also reflect despair that affects their sense of self-worth and identity. It is not simply an isolated thought or prediction but a broad, negative self-description.",Labeling

There is a focus on a bleak, hopeless outcome (""I can't see the way""), and an absolute sense of inability (""I don't have a chance""). These elements show the person is predicting failure or misery in the future. This fits the cognitive distortion of 'Fortune-telling', in which someone predicts a negative outcome as if it is certain.",Fortune-telling

I have no power at all.,"""It's because of my incompetence"", ""I have failed many times"", ""I have no power at all""","The statement attributes multiple failures specifically and solely to the person's incompetence, reflecting an overly broad and negative generalization about oneself. The phrase ""I have failed many times"" combined with ""It's because of my incompetence"" indicates concluding that failure in various instances is entirely due to personal incompetence. This represents a sweeping and generalized belief based on limited events, which aligns with the definition of Overgeneralization. The claim ""I have no power at all"" further magnifies the negative self-assessment but the core distortion is the broad negative conclusion about the self.",Overgeneralization

This reflects making a broad conclusion about learning ability and academic performance based on observed behavior and applying it rigidly to themselves. The key cognitive distortion here is the use of a negative global label ""poor learner"" and overgeneralizing it to all performance outcomes. The thinking pattern goes beyond describing a situation and instead assigns a fixed negative identity and future outcome, which matches the distortion type known as 'Labeling' combined with 'Overgeneralization'. However, since the statement focuses on assigning a negative, global label to the kid and then self, the primary distortion is 'Labeling'.",Labeling
2170,"Now they're giving me a lot of work, and everything else will be unfair to me.","Now they're giving me a lot of work, and everything else will be unfair to me.","The statement begins with an observation ""Now they're giving me a lot of work,"" which is concrete, but then it generalizes the situation by concluding ""everything else will be unfair to me."" This extrapolation assumes that the current situation (lots of work) leads to all other aspects being unfair, without specific evidence. This fits the pattern of overgeneralization, where a single event or circumstance is used to draw an overarching, often negative conclusion.",Overgeneralization

This reflects a black-and-white perspective where something is seen as entirely ineffective. Additionally, the refusal to talk further reinforces a rigid, absolute stance rather than a nuanced view. These characteristics align with 'All-or-Nothing Thinking,' where situations are viewed in extremes without middle ground.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This indicates taking one or few instances and extending them to a broad, definitive self-characterization. The statement also shows an extreme all-encompassing view without middle ground, which aligns with making a broad judgment from limited evidence. Therefore, the distortion is overgeneralization rather than labeling (which is more about assigning a fixed identity, but overgeneralization is the root cognitive error from which the labeling stems). Also, the phrase 'I'm a total loser' is a conclusion drawn based on selective negative events.",Overgeneralization

However, it also contradicts itself by saying the person 'didn't have to call me anything,' which implies there was no necessity for the call. This reflects an internal conflict about expectations. The speaker may be inferring the other person's intentions or feelings without direct evidence, which aligns with 'Mind Reading.' The speaker is assuming that the absence of a call signifies something, even though they acknowledge no obligation to call, suggesting they are interpreting the other's thoughts or motives.",Mind Reading
2177,My mother's path was full of glory.,"""My mother's path was full of glory.""","The statement describes the mother's path as entirely 'full of glory,' which suggests an exaggerated positive evaluation without acknowledging any struggles or negative experiences.

The person is assuming a negative outcome will definitely happen. The statements about not wanting to face the exam or go to school are emotional responses but do not alone suggest 'Emotional Reasoning'.

I'd rather quit the project than worry about it.","The statement shows that the person equates the presence of worry with the necessity to quit the project, indicating a black-and-white perspective. Instead of considering alternatives like continuing despite worry or managing the concern, the person jumps to an extreme action—quitting—based on their emotional response. This reflects an all-or-nothing viewpoint, where the only options are complete engagement without worry or abandoning the project entirely. The worry itself is used as justification to quit rather than as a signal to problem-solve.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The speaker also concludes that because of these feelings and situation, they are a failure, which is an example of labeling (assigning a global negative label to oneself). However, the primary distortion seems to focus on the use of 'always' and the sweeping conclusion about the whole situation, fitting the pattern of Overgeneralization rather than just labeling or other distortions. Emotional reasoning is also present but less dominant, as the key phrase focuses on an all-encompassing negative characterization. Therefore, the best-fitting distortion is Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

The statement ""I'm going to die instantly"" predicts a specific future event without evidence, which aligns with fortune-telling—assuming a negative outcome will happen. Between the two, the more prominent cognitive distortion is the immediate prediction of death, which is an example of fortune-telling because it forecasts a specific catastrophic event without proof.",Fortune-telling

I had to beat him up.""","The statement involves interpreting the cause of the screaming and the reaction to it. The phrase ""I had to beat him up"" suggests a forced necessity based on the emotional disturbance caused. This reflects an underlying Emotional Reasoning distortion, where the speaker feels justified in using violence because of the emotional discomfort (lack of sleep caused by screaming), rather than a rational evaluation of the situation. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, fortune-telling, or others; the key is the emotional justification for an action.",Emotional Reasoning

Furthermore, the phrase 'No wonder no one wants to drive with me' suggests they attribute others' behavior to their self-label without evidence, reinforcing the negative identity. This indicates the cognitive distortion commonly known as 'Labeling,' where one assigns a negative global label to oneself instead of describing specific actions or instances.",Labeling
2197,I'm just a fractional machine. There's no point in me being alive.,"""I'm just a fractional machine"", ""There's no point in me being alive""","The phrase ""I'm just a fractional machine"" indicates a negative global label applied to oneself, reducing identity to a single negative aspect. The follow-up ""There's no point in me being alive"" reflects a sweeping and extreme conclusion about self-worth based on this label. This pattern aligns with labeling, where one assigns a fixed, negative identity to oneself. Other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking or emotional reasoning are less fitting because the statement focuses on self-identification (labeling) rather than dichotomous thinking or feelings as evidence.",Labeling

This reflects predicting negative events without evidence, implying the person is forecasting disaster about future situations. There is no direct evidence of rigid black-and-white thinking, labeling, or personalization. The key element is the prediction of negative outcomes about future events, which corresponds to Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
2201,Maybe it's because we're not familiar enough to communicate with each other.,Maybe it's because we're not familiar enough to communicate with each other.,"The statement suggests an assumption about the cause of communication issues based on perceived unfamiliarity.

This fits the definition of Labeling, where a person assigns a global, negative trait to themselves or others rather than addressing specific behaviors or situations. While there is some distress expressed about not being able to stay with the kid and losing sight, the dominant distortion is this harsh labeling rather than other distortions like emotional reasoning or all-or-nothing thinking.",Labeling
2206,"I learned not to try and worry about it all the time, which in turn would delay learning, but I'm stuck in this cycle.","""I'm stuck in this cycle""; ""worry about it all the time""; ""which in turn would delay learning""","The speaker expresses a sense of being trapped in a repetitive negative pattern ('stuck in this cycle'), suggesting a belief that the current state is unchangeable or continuing indefinitely. The phrase 'which in turn would delay learning' implies a cause-effect expectation that worrying impairs progress. This reflects an expectation about the future outcome based on current feelings or behaviors. However, there is no indication of all-or-nothing terms, labeling, or other distortions.

Father doesn't love his mother.,"The first phrase 'Parents don't get divorced' suggests an absolute belief without room for exceptions, hinting at black-and-white or absolute thinking. The second phrase 'Third year shows up because of me' indicates taking personal responsibility for an event that likely involves external factors, which aligns with personalization. The third phrase 'Father doesn't love his mother' reflects an assumption about someone else's feelings without evidence, characteristic of mind reading. Among these, the statement 'Third year shows up because of me' reflects personalization most clearly because it attributes an event directly to the speaker's influence, possibly inaccurately. While other distortions appear, personalization is the most fitting for the overall statement.",Personalization

The statement ""you'll be able to take your own vacation"" predicts a favorable event happening based on the near-future context. This is an example of predicting a future event with certainty without having actual evidence that it will happen.

The phrase ""There's no end to the overtime"" suggests a belief that overtime will continue indefinitely, which is an 'Overgeneralization' because it applies one experience to an endless pattern. Since only one distortion should be chosen, 'Mind Reading' is more central here as the speaker assumes malicious intent explicitly.",Mind Reading
2210,My parents always ignore me. It makes me feel bad.,"""My parents always ignore me.""","The statement uses the word 'always' to generalize a specific behavior to an all-encompassing, unchanging pattern. This suggests the person interprets occasional or perceived instances of being ignored as a constant occurrence, which is characteristic of overgeneralization. The feeling of being ignored all the time leads to feeling bad, but the distortion lies in the exaggeration of frequency rather than an emotional conclusion or assumed thoughts of others.",Overgeneralization

I'm going to have another one.,"The statement identifies a problem with the health of a store and immediately concludes that the person will experience another health problem. This reflects a prediction about a future negative event without evidence, implying certainty of a negative outcome. The key phrase 'I'm going to have another one' suggests predicting an inevitable negative outcome based on a current problem. This fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling,' where someone predicts a negative future event without sufficient evidence.",Fortune-telling

The statement labels the speaker with a negative identity rather than describing a specific behavior or situation. The follow-up ""I need more exercise to control my weight"" supports the idea that the speaker believes their weight defines them, hence adopting a self-critical label. There is no indication of extreme either/or thinking, predicting the future, or filtering of information. The focus is on attaching a global negative label to the self.",Labeling

This shows an assumption or prediction about a future positive outcome based on the current negative symptom without evidence. It is not an all-or-nothing extreme judgment, nor labeling, nor magnification or minimization in a negative sense. The individual is essentially predicting a favorable outcome (good luck) tied to their symptom, which aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

The description of the classmate as a ""big mouth"" is a negative label applied to a person based on one characteristic or behavior. This fits the definition of 'Labeling,' where a person is defined by a single negative trait. Between these two, the primary cognitive distortion in the statement centers on labeling the classmate in a negative way rather than simply thinking in absolutes about the situation.

There is no evidence of negative or distorted thinking here; instead, it reflects a realistic expectation and hopeful anticipation. The phrase does not suggest any cognitive distortion like all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or fortune-telling. Therefore, this statement does not fit any cognitive distortion types listed.",No Distortion

The speaker then justifies not staying all day based on these emotions. The reasoning is based on the speaker's feelings ('I feel sorry,' 'I feel sad') as a rationale for their inability to stay all day, suggesting that their emotions are guiding the logic of the situation. This is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning, where the person believes something is true because they feel it so strongly, rather than based on objective evidence. There is no indication of exaggeration, absolute thinking, predicting the future, or labeling involved.",Emotional Reasoning
2223,I'm so sorry. Why is it always hard for me? I'll always be so sad.,"""Why is it always hard for me?"", ""I'll always be so sad.""","The phrase ""always"" indicates that the person is making a broad generalization about their experience, assuming that difficulty and sadness will persist indefinitely without exception. This reflects a pattern of applying a single negative event to their entire life or future, which is characteristic of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2224,I'm supposed to be fat all my life without self-control.,"""I'm supposed to be fat all my life without self-control""","The phrase ""I'm supposed to be fat all my life"" indicates a belief about how things must be or should be, reflecting rigid expectations. The use of ""supposed to be"" implies a standard or rule the person feels obliged to follow, which aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Should statements. The statement is not just describing a fact, but imposing a harsh, inflexible rule on the self related to weight and self-control. Therefore, it fits best with Should statements rather than other distortions like Overgeneralization or Labeling.",Should statements
2225,He said that I had completely dropped the bond between us and had to talk about it anyway.,"""He said that I had completely dropped the bond between us""","The key phrase indicates that the speaker is assuming to know exactly what the other person thinks or feels about the relationship, specifically that the bond is completely broken. This reflects an interpretation of another person's thoughts or emotions without direct evidence. Therefore, this aligns with the cognitive distortion of Mind Reading, where one presumes to understand others' mental states.",Mind Reading
2226,War is scary. I don't know how to solve it.,"""War is scary"", ""I don't know how to solve it""","The statement expresses a feeling that war is inherently frightening, which is an emotional response. The second part shows uncertainty about finding a solution. The focus is on the fear derived from the emotion rather than objective evidence or logical analysis. This indicates that the perception of war as 'scary' is based on an emotional feeling rather than facts. This fits the cognitive distortion of Emotional Reasoning, where one assumes that their emotional reaction reflects the truth about a situation.",Emotional Reasoning

I'm not a graduate student.,"""It's not a good project."" and ""I'm not a graduate student.""","The speaker judges the project negatively based on their own status ('I'm not a graduate student'), implying that because they lack a particular label or qualification, the project cannot be good. This reflects labeling, where a global negative label is being assigned to the project and to themselves based on limited information. The statement does not show extremes (all-or-nothing), predictions about the future (fortune-telling), or believing something to be true just because of feelings (emotional reasoning). It is an example of labeling both the project and self in a negative way.",Labeling

This involves making broad, sweeping conclusions based on limited evidence, suggesting that the speaker believes the current difficulties define all future social interactions. This pattern aligns with overgeneralization, where one negative event or feeling is extended to a wide array of situations without considering exceptions or change.",Overgeneralization
2230,Let's go to the library. We don't study in the bedroom.,Let's go to the library. We don't study in the bedroom.,"The phrase 'We don't study in the bedroom' prescribes a strict rule or expectation about where studying should occur. This reflects a 'should statement,' where certain behaviors or actions are dictated as necessary or appropriate. The sentence is not making an absolute judgment about all situations (not all-or-nothing), nor guessing the future (fortune-telling), nor assuming others’ thoughts (mind reading). Rather, it imposes a normative rule about behavior.",Should statements
2231,"I know I shouldn't have done this, but I still regret getting pregnant and getting married.","""I know I shouldn't have done this"", ""I still regret getting pregnant and getting married.""","The phrase 'I know I shouldn't have done this' reflects the use of 'should' which imposes rigid rules or expectations on oneself. This indicates the presence of 'Should statements', which involve having inflexible beliefs about how oneself or others should behave. The regret expressed also stems from this judgmental thinking. There is no evidence of extreme all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, or other distortions, making 'Should statements' the best fit.",Should statements

If I don't pass my test, it's over.","If I don't pass my test, it's over.","The phrase 'If I don't pass my test, it's over' indicates an extreme and absolute way of thinking with no middle ground or alternative outcomes considered. The person sees the situation in black-and-white terms: either they pass and everything is fine, or they fail and their life is completely over. This aligns with the definition of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where situations are perceived in extremes.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2233,Money sucks and shit. What can I do? I'm a social animal.,"""Money sucks and shit.""","The statement ""Money sucks and shit"" expresses a global negative evaluation of money, implying it is entirely bad without nuance or exception. This is characteristic of overgeneralization, where a single negative aspect or experience is extended to a broad, overarching negative conclusion about the whole concept (money). The rest of the statement ""What can I do? I'm a social animal."" reflects a feeling of helplessness and social dependency but does not introduce a different distortion related to the first phrase.",Overgeneralization
2234,It's because I don't usually work well. God makes me suffer.,"""I don't usually work well""; ""God makes me suffer""","The statement ""I don't usually work well"" reflects a negative belief about oneself, potentially indicating a generalized negative self-assessment. The phrase ""God makes me suffer"" externalizes the cause of suffering to a higher power, implying that the individual's pain is directly caused by divine intervention or punishment. This external attribution attributes personal suffering to an external force rather than internal or situational factors. The key cognitive distortion here is Personalization, because the speaker is blaming their suffering directly on God rather than considering other factors; it is an over-attribution of cause to a specific source connected to oneself. It is not All-or-Nothing, Fortune-telling, or Should statements since there is no absolute thinking, no prediction of future events, or prescriptive demands. Emotional Reasoning could be considered, but the reasoning goes beyond feelings to assign blame externally. Therefore, Personalization is the best fit.",Personalization

This shows a pattern where one or two negative experiences or aspects are being generalized to apply universally and all the time ('always bullied'). Therefore, the person is overgeneralizing from specific behaviors to a broad and absolute outcome.",Overgeneralization
2237,He's actually acting out of concern for me.,"""He's actually acting out of concern for me.""","The statement attributes a specific motive (concern) to the other person's actions without evidence.

2238,"He leaked my secret, and he let me know, but in the way of this friendship, I pretended I didn't know.","He leaked my secret, he let me know, I pretended I didn't know","The speaker describes an event where someone disclosed a secret and also revealed they knew about it, but the speaker acted as if they were unaware. There is no indication of extreme thinking, catastrophic prediction, or labeling. The speaker does not appear to be attributing excessive blame to themselves or imagining others' thoughts beyond what is stated. Instead, the focus is on selective attention to one aspect of the situation (pretending ignorance) while ignoring the emotional impact or other details, which aligns with filtering out certain realities. Therefore, the distortion is best aligned with 'Mental filter,' where the individual focuses on a single detail and minimizes others.",Mental filter

Finally, it generalizes this negative experience about one person to the entire concept of marriage. This broad negative conclusion based on a specific instance exemplifies an overgeneralization, where a single negative situation is applied to all situations of the same kind.",Overgeneralization

The speaker interprets the son's departure as a personal failure, assuming responsibility for an outcome that may not be entirely within their control. This reflects an excessive attribution of events to oneself, typical of personalization. The feeling of failure is inferred from the son's action, rather than an objective assessment. The distortion lies in taking the son's leaving as evidence of personal failure.",Personalization
2243,I knew I shouldn't drive because I was driving too slow to keep so many people here.,I knew I shouldn't drive because I was driving too slow to keep so many people here.,"The statement uses 'I shouldn't' which indicates the use of 'should' or 'must' statements, where the person imposes strict rules or expectations on their own behavior. The thought suggests the person believes they 'shouldn't' drive due to driving too slowly and negatively affecting others. This fits the 'Should statements' distortion, as it involves self-imposed rules related to behavior without accounting for flexibility or context.",Should statements
2244,Why can't I sleep? Is something wrong with my body lately? I'm a little worried.,"""Why can't I sleep?"" ""Is something wrong with my body lately?"" ""I'm a little worried.""","The person is interpreting their difficulty sleeping as evidence that something must be wrong with their body. This is a conclusion based on their emotional response (worry) rather than objective facts. They are using their feeling of worry as proof that a negative health problem exists. This matches the pattern of Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as evidence of truth.",Emotional Reasoning
2245,"When I'm so big, I'm going to be blind, and my life is ruined.","""When I'm so big, I'm going to be blind, and my life is ruined.""","The statement predicts a negative outcome in the future without evidence, assuming blindness and a ruined life simply due to becoming 'so big.' This is an example of predicting an undesired future event without justification, which aligns with Fortune-telling.

2246,My only friend is alienating me. My life is completely alone.,"""My only friend is alienating me"", ""My life is completely alone""",The speaker generalizes from one situation (a single friend alienating them) to a broad conclusion about their entire life (being completely alone). This suggests an overgeneralization where one negative event or circumstance is taken as evidence of a pervasive and permanent condition.,Overgeneralization
2247,I must thank him when I'm cured.,"""I must thank him when I'm cured.""","The key phrase is 'I must thank him,' which indicates an obligation or a rule about how the speaker thinks they should behave.

2248,It's over. I can't finish my career without a story.,"""It's over."" and ""I can't finish my career without a story.""","The phrase ""It's over."" indicates a belief that there is no possibility of continuation or success, implying a complete failure or end. The statement ""I can't finish my career without a story."" suggests a rigid, black-and-white thinking style—either the career is finished successfully with a story or it is completely failed and over. This reflects the cognitive distortion type known as All-or-Nothing Thinking, where situations are seen in extremes with no middle ground or possibility of partial success.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The speaker is not just criticizing a behavior but labeling the entire person negatively. This is an example of 'Labeling' because it involves defining someone by a negative trait without considering other aspects. The demand that the coach 'must' be a certain way may hint at other distortions, but the core distortion is the harsh negative name-calling of the coach.",Labeling
2250,My friend's mom makes the best homemade nachos. He just brought me three bags. Now I want to eat them all.,My friend's mom makes the best homemade nachos. He just brought me three bags. Now I want to eat them all.,"The statement expresses a desire to eat all the nachos now that the friend brought three bags. There is no indication of a cognitive distortion such as exaggeration, judging, predicting negative outcomes, or self-blaming. The sentence is a straightforward description of a craving or desire without any irrational thinking patterns. Therefore, there is no cognitive distortion present.",No Distortion

My life is going to be ruined.,"""I've never seen a man as lazy as me""; ""My life is going to be ruined.""","The first phrase, 'I've never seen a man as lazy as me,' involves drawing a broad, absolute conclusion about oneself based on potentially limited evidence, which aligns with overgeneralization. The second phrase, 'My life is going to be ruined,' is a prediction about the future without factual basis, characteristic of fortune-telling. Since the instruction is to classify into ONE distortion type, the primary cognitive distortion reflected here is overgeneralization because the speaker makes a sweeping negative judgment about their character ('as lazy as me'). The catastrophic future prediction follows from this overgeneralized self-label but is secondary.",Overgeneralization
2252,"I'm very restless, so wet that I'm going home, and I'm very unhappy.","""I'm very restless"", ""so wet that I'm going home"", ""I'm very unhappy""","The statement expresses emotional distress and uses the feeling of restlessness and being very wet as a basis for the decision to go home and the conclusion of unhappiness. The speaker is inferring their unhappiness based on how they feel (restlessness and discomfort), which aligns with interpreting emotions as evidence of reality. This fits the definition of Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as factual indicators of one's situation.",Emotional Reasoning

It's wrong not to listen to them.,"""They blame me for this."", ""I should get married early."", ""It's wrong not to listen to them.""","The key phrase ""I should get married early"" directly uses a 'should' statement, which indicates an internal rule or demand is being placed on the self. The phrase ""It's wrong not to listen to them"" reinforces this by implying a moral obligation or rigid rule about behavior. Although ""They blame me for this"" could suggest Personalization or Mind Reading, the dominant cognitive distortion in the statement is the use of 'should,' which reflects rigid and inflexible expectations.",Should statements

2255,"I am a loser, not only with no goal, no vision, no capacity.","""I am a loser"", ""no goal"", ""no vision"", ""no capacity""","The statement uses a negative label 'loser' to describe the entire identity of the speaker, which is a classic example of labeling. Additionally, the speaker generalizes this label by stating they have no goal, vision, or capacity, further cementing a negative and rigid self-assessment. This goes beyond specific instances or behaviors and targets the person's overall character, fitting the labeling distortion.",Labeling

""I'm useless.""","The phrase ""They'll never let me show it again"" involves predicting a negative outcome without evidence, which fits the definition of Fortune-telling. The statement ""I'm useless"" is a negative label that the speaker applies to themselves, fitting Labeling. However, since the task is to select only ONE cognitive distortion, the most prominent distortion influencing the thought process is Fortune-telling, as the speaker assumes a negative future event will certainly occur. Labeling is present but secondary to the predictive negative assumption.",Fortune-telling
2257,"If you keep a good mind, you'll get better.","""If you keep a good mind, you'll get better.""","The statement suggests a cause-effect relationship implying that maintaining a positive mindset directly results in improvement.

Therefore, it involves predicting future events without evidence, fitting the definition of Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
2258,I'm a midget who's never grown enough to be a capital for everyone's pleasure.,"""I'm a midget"", ""never grown enough to be a capital for everyone's pleasure""","The key phrase ""I'm a midget"" is a label the speaker assigns to themselves, which is a negative and absolute term describing their identity. The phrase ""never grown enough to be a capital for everyone's pleasure"" further reinforces a negative self-assessment based on a fixed label. This reflects the distortion of reducing oneself to a simplistic and derogatory label rather than viewing the situation more holistically or flexibly.",Labeling
2259,"I've had cramps for so long, and the lifeguards aren't as efficient as the rest of the world.","""I've had cramps for so long"", ""lifeguards aren't as efficient as the rest of the world""","The statement generalizes the inefficiency of the lifeguards not just to a specific event but compares them negatively against the entire rest of the world, implying a broad and sweeping judgment based on limited experience. This is characteristic of overgeneralization, where a single or a few instances are used to make a global conclusion.",Overgeneralization

""My life is meant to be a sick life.""","The statement expresses a prediction about the future ('Insomnia may be with me for the rest of my life') without certainty, which matches 'Fortune-telling.' The phrase 'My life is meant to be a sick life' generalizes the situation about insomnia to the entirety of the person's life, implying a permanent and all-encompassing condition. This reflects an overgeneralization, turning one aspect of life into the defining characteristic of the whole life. Since the statement combines an uncertain future prediction and an overarching generalization, but the dominant feature is the sweeping generalization about life based on insomnia, the primary distortion is 'Overgeneralization.'",Overgeneralization
2261,"I felt at the funeral that my colleagues were looking at me, that their eyes were filled with compassion and sarcasm, and that my heart was very hurt.","my colleagues were looking at me, that their eyes were filled with compassion and sarcasm","The statement involves the speaker assuming they know exactly what their colleagues are thinking and feeling (compassion and sarcasm) without any direct evidence. This reflects an inference about others' thoughts and intentions. It is not simple emotional reasoning (which would be basing truth on feelings alone) since the speaker is interpreting others' feelings. The speaker is essentially 'reading the minds' of their colleagues. Therefore, the cognitive distortion involved here is Mind Reading.",Mind Reading

The speaker assumes without evidence that failure in the exam will inevitably lead to two specific undesirable consequences: not being able to express preferences and not missing the book. This prediction about the future without sufficient evidence fits the cognitive distortion known as 'Fortune-telling,' where one forecasts negative outcomes prematurely.",Fortune-telling

I'm a piece of shit!,"""How could I be so careless?"", ""I can't lose something so precious!"", ""I'm so useless!"", ""I'm a piece of shit!""","The statement contains self-critical and extreme negative labels about oneself such as ""I'm so useless!"" and ""I'm a piece of shit!"". These phrases assign a harsh, global label to the person based on a single event or behavior (being careless). This fits the pattern of Labeling, where one characterizes oneself in a negative way rather than focusing on specific actions. While there is some emotional distress and exaggeration, the core distortion is assigning a negative identity rather than cognitive patterns like all-or-nothing thinking or magnification alone.",Labeling
2264,What can you do when you're so fat?,"""so fat""","The speaker is using the phrase ""so fat"" as a definitive label to describe themselves negatively. This is a clear example of labeling, where a person assigns a fixed, global negative label to themselves rather than describing specific behaviors or situations. The statement is not predicting the future (fortune-telling), it is not about all-or-nothing thinking or magnification in terms of extremes or catastrophizing, nor does it involve personalization, mental filter, or any other cognitive distortion as closely as labeling does.",Labeling

After all these years of education, I've developed a white-eyed wolf like myself!","""I'm such a son of a bitch to make my parents so sad"", ""I've developed a white-eyed wolf like myself""","The speaker is attributing a very negative and sweeping global label to themselves ('son of a bitch' and 'white-eyed wolf'), which are harsh, derogatory terms that characterize their entire self-worth negatively. This indicates they are engaging in Labeling, as they are assigning a negative, fixed identity to themselves rather than focusing on specific behaviors or circumstances. The statement also implies a strong emotional reaction but the core distortion is the negative self-label. The phrase about making their parents sad may be personalization, but the defining feature is the global negative self-label.",Labeling
2266,"If I continue to do so, I will offend many and my life will be completely subverted.","""If I continue to do so, I will offend many""; ""my life will be completely subverted""","The speaker predicts a negative future outcome ('I will offend many' and 'my life will be completely subverted') based on a current action without evidence that this will happen. This is a form of predicting a negative future event with certainty, which corresponds with the cognitive distortion known as Fortune-telling.

The phrase ""It's not fair"" indicates a judgment based on an unmet expectation (something should be different), which aligns with the 'Should statements' distortion where the person is evaluating their situation against ideal or expected conditions. The repetition of being out of work reinforces the focus on the perceived injustice, but does not necessarily indicate other distortions like overgeneralization or magnification since no broad negative conclusion or exaggeration is made beyond the judgment of fairness.",Should statements

2270,"I'm just a man who's not fit for sports. Look, eventually something's happened.","""I'm just a man who's not fit for sports""","The phrase ""I'm just a man who's not fit for sports"" indicates labeling, where the speaker assigns a negative global label to themselves based on perceived inadequacy in sports. This reflects defining themselves as fundamentally unfit rather than considering specific instances or contexts. The rest of the sentence ""Look, eventually something's happened"" does not introduce another cognitive distortion, so the primary distortion is labeling.",Labeling
2271,"He must have thought I was a bully, so he went to find someone else and set me free.","""He must have thought I was a bully"", ""he went to find someone else"", ""set me free""","The phrase ""He must have thought I was a bully"" indicates that the speaker is assuming they know what another person is thinking without any direct evidence. This is characteristic of mind reading, where one believes they know others' thoughts or intentions. The other parts ""he went to find someone else"" and ""set me free"" support the interpretation that the speaker is inferring the motives and thoughts of the other person. There is no indication of exaggeration, all-or-nothing thinking, or personalization beyond the assumed thought, so the primary distortion is mind reading.",Mind Reading
2272,"If he earns his own money, he owns his freedom, and even a couple shouldn't tell him what to do.","""he owns his freedom if he earns his own money""; ""even a couple shouldn't tell him what to do""","The statement implies a rigid rule about ownership of freedom based solely on earning money. It suggests that if a person earns money, they automatically have complete freedom and cannot be told what to do even within a couple's relationship. This reflects a rigid belief about how things must be, indicating an inflexible 'should' or 'must' mindset about control and autonomy in relationships. The phrase 'shouldn't tell him what to do' directly represents a 'should statement' cognitive distortion, where there is an imposing rule about how things are supposed to be.",Should statements

The speaker is making a positive forecast about justice being served in the future despite current uncertainty or fear. The rest of the sentence acknowledges fear but resolves to act regardless, which does not distort the thinking negatively. Therefore, the main cognitive distortion lies in the assumption about an inevitable future event.",Fortune-telling

2276,"It must have been someone defaming me in front of the boss, causing the boss to misunderstand me.","someone defaming me in front of the boss, causing the boss to misunderstand me","The individual assumes that the boss’s misunderstanding is directly caused by someone defaming them, without concrete evidence of who the defamer is or that defamation indeed took place. This involves making assumptions about others' thoughts or intentions (the defamer’s action) and the boss’s reaction based on those unverified beliefs. This aligns with 'Mind Reading', where one infers what others think or believe without factual proof.",Mind Reading
2277,"I am so unimportant in the eyes of all, and I am worthless and unmindful.","""I am so unimportant in the eyes of all"", ""I am worthless"", ""I am unmindful""","The speaker makes a sweeping negative judgment about themselves ('unimportant in the eyes of all'), implying that everyone views them negatively without specific evidence. This reflects a global negative evaluation. Additionally, the speaker labels themselves as 'worthless' and 'unmindful,' assigning fixed, negative labels rather than considering specific behaviors or instances. This pattern fits the definition of 'Labeling,' where a person describes themselves with negative sweeping terms instead of addressing discrete aspects.",Labeling
2278,"I usually eat barbecues, don't pay attention to diets, I like to drink, and I get brain tumors.","usually eat barbecues, don't pay attention to diets, like to drink, get brain tumors","The statement connects habitual behaviors (eating barbecues, not dieting, drinking) directly to getting brain tumors. This suggests a predictive conclusion about future negative health outcomes based on current habits, without evidence that those habits will definitively cause brain tumors. This reflects making a negative prediction about the future outcome without certainty, which corresponds to fortune-telling distortion.",Fortune-telling

This reflects an extreme evaluation without considering exceptions or positive aspects. The phrase 'only a father who's bad' suggests the speaker is viewing the father in black-and-white terms rather than acknowledging complexity or variation in behavior. This aligns with the cognitive distortion known as overgeneralization, where one negative aspect leads to a sweeping, overall negative judgment.",Overgeneralization

When this expectation isn’t met, they attribute the failure to their own inadequacy ('I'm still short of what I can do'). This reflects a negative self-assessment based on one event. However, there is no evidence the speaker assumes all future hiring will fail (overgeneralization), or that they must be hired (should statements). Instead, the thought process implies an expectation and self-judgment rooted in an unrealistic prediction of HR's behavior ('HR doesn't hire me, as I expected'). The reasoning points towards Fortune-telling, as the individual predicts a negative outcome (not being hired) and links it to their perceived shortcomings without considering other factors.",Fortune-telling

This reflects a strict black-and-white viewpoint, where no middle ground or alternative perspective is considered. The statement excludes any possibility of overlapping or complex family dynamics and insists on an either/or categorization.

The phrase 'I'm getting worse and worse' indicates a broad generalization from a specific issue.

This involves making a negative prediction about the future. The person is assuming that because the parent has a disease, the child will inevitably have it as well, which fits the definition of fortune-telling, where one predicts negative outcomes without definite proof. Other distortions like overgeneralization or magnification might involve broader conclusions or exaggerations, but here the focus is on predicting a specific future negative event.",Fortune-telling

This reflects Overgeneralization, where one assumes something is always true based on limited evidence. The phrases 'Why don't you just borrow it again?' and 'It's a waste of my time.' express frustration but do not strongly indicate other cognitive distortions by themselves.

This fits with Fortune-telling, where one assumes an adverse future without proof. It is not All-or-Nothing because it does not present a purely black-or-white view about the self or events in the present, but strictly predicts future rejection. It is not Mind Reading because the person does not claim to know others' thoughts but predicts future reactions. It is not Overgeneralization because the statement is about future denial and intolerance rather than deriving a broad conclusion from a single event. Emotional Reasoning is not dominant here as the statement is more cognitive prediction than based on feelings. Thus, the best fit is Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

The other phrases reflect the event and its impact but the central distortion comes from the self-judgment in ""I was so stupid"". Therefore, labeling is the appropriate cognitive distortion here.",Labeling

It indicates the person is using one negative outcome or situation to make a global, absolute conclusion about their whole life. This overextends a specific outcome to cover an extensive domain without sufficient evidence. The first sentence about a stolen takeout expresses worry about a negative event but it is the second sentence that most clearly reflects the cognitive distortion, as it portrays an all-encompassing negative label on life. This process aligns with the definition of Overgeneralization, where a single incident is used to make a broad negative conclusion.",Overgeneralization
2290,"I may have made a lot of mistakes, which led to my illness.","I may have made a lot of mistakes, which led to my illness.","The statement attributes the cause of the illness directly to personal mistakes. This shows a tendency to personalize the situation by assuming full responsibility for the illness without considering other external or medical factors. There is no absolute or all-or-nothing language, nor predicting future events, judging self with negative labels, focusing only on negatives, or using 'should' statements. The key distortion here is taking personal blame for an outcome, which aligns with Personalization.",Personalization

The negative label ""boring"" applied to the game is a form of labeling, which is assigning a global negative label to something based on a subjective feeling. The other parts do not strongly indicate other distortions like all-or-nothing or fortune-telling. Therefore, the central cognitive distortion is the labeling of the game as boring.",Labeling

My feelings of inferiority are magnified.,"""I'm magnifying my flaws"", ""I'm so ugly"", ""My feelings of inferiority are magnified""","The speaker explicitly states they are magnifying their flaws and feelings, which indicates an exaggerated perception of negative aspects about themselves. The use of the word 'magnifying' directly points to an amplification of faults or feelings, fitting the cognitive distortion known as Magnification. Although there are elements of labeling ('I'm so ugly') and emotional reasoning ('My feelings of inferiority'), the core distortion is the exaggeration or amplification of negative self-perceptions.",Magnification
2295,It's all my fault that all the unruly evils come to us.,"""It's all my fault""; ""all the unruly evils come to us""","The key phrase ""It's all my fault"" reflects the speaker attributing total blame to themselves for negative events or circumstances. This attribution goes beyond a reasonable assessment of personal responsibility and implies that they are the sole cause of all negative occurrences described as ""all the unruly evils."" This fits the cognitive distortion where a person personalizes external events and believes they are responsible for things beyond their control. The statement does not fit other distortions like mind reading or fortune-telling because it is about self-blame rather than predicting the future or assuming others' thoughts. It is also not all-or-nothing thinking since the absolute term ""all"" is used in the sense of responsibility rather than success/failure dichotomy. Hence, the distortion fitting best is Personalization.",Personalization
2296,"What a pity, my cake shop failed because of the epidemic.","""my cake shop failed because of the epidemic""","The statement attributes the failure of the cake shop specifically to the epidemic, indicating a cause-and-effect conclusion without considering other possible factors. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, magnification, or other distortions. The person is not emotionally reasoning or fortune-telling; they are simply assigning blame externally. However, this assumption may reflect 'Personalization' if the person sees the failure as something that happened because of an external uncontrollable factor rather than internal factors. But personalization usually involves blaming oneself for external events. Here, the blame is placed on the epidemic, which is an external uncontrollable cause. Therefore, the statement is more of a factual attribution, and no cognitive distortion is clearly present. Hence, the most appropriate label is 'No Distortion'.",No Distortion

Additionally, they imply that their current hard work is a direct result of past carelessness, showing self-blame for the situation. This reflects personalization, where the individual believes they are the primary cause of negative events affecting others, even when other factors are likely involved.",Personalization

How can I meet a prince?","""I'm not a princess at all, but a maid near the princess""; ""How can I meet a prince?""","The speaker labels themselves as a 'maid' rather than a 'princess,' implying a fixed negative identity. This labeling leads to a conclusion that meeting 'Prince Charming' is impossible. The statement shows a core negative self-label which affects expectations about outcomes adversely. This fits the 'Labeling' distortion because the individual assigns a global negative label to themselves that influences their beliefs and actions.",Labeling

2309,It's such a waste to ask my friends to help me downstairs.,"""It's such a waste to ask my friends to help me downstairs.""","The statement expresses a negative evaluation of the act of asking friends for help, implying it is a 'waste.' This reflects an overestimation of the negative consequences of seeking help and undervaluing the potential positive outcomes (e.g., support, friendship). The speaker is likely magnifying the cost or burden of asking for help, rather than recognizing that friends might be willing and happy to assist.

The phrases express a sense of inevitability about ongoing suffering and disastrous life consequences. This matches the cognitive distortion known as Fortune-telling, where a person assumes negative outcomes will happen in the future.",Fortune-telling
2329,I should take care of myself so that I don't get hurt by the wrong words.,"""I should take care of myself""; ""so that I don't get hurt by the wrong words""","The statement includes the phrase ""I should take care of myself,"" indicating a sense of obligation or a rigid rule the speaker is placing on themselves. This is characteristic of ""Should statements,"" where the individual imposes what they think they must do, often leading to guilt or pressure. The second part, ""so that I don't get hurt by the wrong words,"" implies a motivation behind the obligation but does not shift the distortion type—it's the presence of the word ""should"" that defines the cognitive distortion here.",Should statements
2330,I don't know why I've been doing this lately. Let's go to the hospital and check it out. It's more reassuring.,"""I don't know why I've been doing this lately."" and ""Let's go to the hospital and check it out. It's more reassuring.""","The speaker expresses uncertainty about their behavior and seeks reassurance by going to the hospital. The statement 'It's more reassuring' indicates they are using their feelings of discomfort or anxiety as evidence that their actions (going to the hospital) are necessary. This reflects the cognitive distortion where emotional states are interpreted as factual evidence, which corresponds to Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
2331,I'm not the one who gave the speech.,"""I'm not the one who gave the speech.""","The statement is simply a factual declaration denying responsibility or authorship of a speech. There is no evidence of distortion such as extreme thinking, assuming others' thoughts, predicting future events, or emotional justification. It does not label anyone negatively, magnify or filter information, or impose unrealistic expectations. Therefore, it does not exhibit any cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

I didn't expect the boss to value me so much.,"""I'm sure the boss is trying to promote me on so many missions"", ""I didn't expect the boss to value me so much""","The statement involves a strong assumption about the boss's intentions without direct evidence. The speaker is claiming certainty about what the boss is thinking or planning (promoting on missions and valuing the speaker), which reflects an assumption about another person's thoughts or motives. This aligns with 'Mind Reading,' as the speaker is interpreting the boss's thoughts and intentions without verifying them.",Mind Reading
2333,The epidemic will not end. My life will end in the epidemic.,"""The epidemic will not end."" and ""My life will end in the epidemic.""","The statement predicts a negative outcome with certainty about the future, specifically that the epidemic will never end and the speaker's life will end because of it. This involves making a definitive prediction without evidence, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling'. There is also some exaggeration of the negative consequence, but the core distortion lies in the certain negative prediction.",Fortune-telling
2334,"I'm so big, my parents feel tired, I'm so useless, my life is so bad.","""I'm so big, my parents feel tired"", ""I'm so useless"", ""my life is so bad""","The statement contains exaggerated negative self-judgments such as ""I'm so useless"" and a global negative evaluation of life as ""so bad."" There is also an implied cause-effect relationship in ""my parents feel tired"" because of the speaker being ""so big."" These reflections indicate an extreme negative labeling of self-worth and a sweeping generalization about life circumstances. However, the predominant cognitive distortion is the use of a negative global label toward oneself: ""useless."" This is a classic example of Labeling, where a person's identity is defined by a negative attribute rather than specific behaviors or situations.",Labeling
2335,"I'll meet my partner, too. It's just a matter of time.","I'll meet my partner, too. It's just a matter of time.","The statement expresses a positive prediction about the future event of meeting the partner, indicating certainty about something that has not yet happened but is expected to occur. This fits the pattern of 'Fortune-telling,' where someone predicts a future outcome with confidence despite lack of concrete evidence. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, labeling, magnification, mental filter, mind reading, overgeneralization, personalization, or should statements in this expression. The tone is hopeful and predictive rather than distorted negatively or absolutes-based.",Fortune-telling

This reflects an assumption about others' thoughts or feelings. It is not focusing on all successes being good or bad (All-or-Nothing), nor is it an exaggerated belief (Magnification), nor assigning a fixed global label to self or others (Labeling). It is best described as 'Mind Reading', where the speaker believes they know what others think or say without concrete proof.",Mind Reading

Why waste that time?","""I don't have to review my next exam"", ""I don't have to do it anyway"", ""Why waste that time?""","The statement reflects a dismissive attitude toward preparing for the exam, implying that review is unnecessary. The phrase ""I don't have to do it anyway"" suggests an internal rule or belief about what the person 'must' or 'must not' do, aligned with 'should' or 'should not' thinking. This is indicative of the 'Should statements' distortion, where one sets rigid rules and expectations on oneself, often leading to avoidance or guilt. The statement lacks elements of other distortions like all-or-nothing (which involve extremes), fortune-telling (predicting the future negatively), or mind reading (assuming others' thoughts). Instead, it focuses on a personal rule that reviewing is unnecessary, categorizing it best as a 'Should statements' distortion.",Should statements
2338,How do I know I'm losing weight or I can't control it? How can I do this? I'm so guilty.,"""How do I know I'm losing weight or I can't control it? How can I do this? I'm so guilty.""","The statement expresses self-doubt and anxiety about control over weight loss, followed by an immediate conclusion of feeling guilty. The phrase 'I'm so guilty' is a direct emotional judgment of oneself, which seems to stem from the emotions felt rather than objective evidence. This fits Emotional Reasoning where the person assumes their negative feelings (guilt) reflect the reality (lack of control or failure). The other parts show worry and uncertainty but do not explicitly state a predictive outcome (fortune-telling) or an extreme viewpoint (all-or-nothing).",Emotional Reasoning
2339,He's very attached to talking to me. It's a sign of respect.,"""He's very attached to talking to me. It's a sign of respect.""","The statement draws a direct conclusion about another person's feelings and intentions based solely on their behavior, without explicit confirmation ('He's very attached to talking to me' is interpreted as 'It's a sign of respect'). This reflects assuming the other person's internal state or motives without evidence, which matches the definition of Mind Reading.",Mind Reading
2340,"Schools cannot control these children, and they will become social cancers in the future.","""Schools cannot control these children"", ""they will become social cancers in the future""","The statement makes a sweeping generalization that all these children are uncontrollable and destined to become harmful to society. It predicts a negative future outcome without evidence, which aligns with predicting a specific negative future outcome. The phrase 'they will become social cancers' is a labeling that assigns a fixed negative identity to the group. However, since the core issue is the prediction of a negative future without sufficient evidence, the primary distortion is fortune-telling. Although there is some labeling involved, the dominant distortion is making an unsubstantiated negative prediction about the future.",Fortune-telling
2341,It's hard to buy drugs at a pharmacy now. When is this life gonna be the head?,"""It's hard to buy drugs at a pharmacy now."" ""When is this life gonna be the head?""","The statement expresses a frustration about the difficulty of buying drugs at a pharmacy, which is a specific problem. The second sentence, 'When is this life gonna be the head?', suggests a pessimistic prediction about life improving or getting better, implying a negative expectation about the future. This is an example of predicting a negative outcome without sufficient evidence, which aligns with the cognitive distortion known as 'Fortune-telling'. The speaker assumes that life will continue to be difficult without any positive change.",Fortune-telling
2342,I'm sure my own age despises me and thinks I'm nothing.,"""I'm sure my own age despises me""; ""thinks I'm nothing""","The speaker assumes they know what others, specifically their own age group, think about them without any real evidence. They are attributing negative thoughts and feelings to others as if they can read their minds. This matches the hallmark of Mind Reading, where one believes they can discern others' thoughts or feelings, usually negative, without actual proof. Although the statement also includes a negative assumption about how they are perceived, it is primarily about assuming knowledge of others' thoughts.",Mind Reading
2343,I can't imitate his way of driving. That's just another man's scolding.,"""I can't imitate his way of driving."" and ""That's just another man's scolding.""","The first part, ""I can't imitate his way of driving,"" expresses a negative personal judgment or inability, but it is a specific statement rather than an overgeneralization or all-or-nothing thinking. The second part, ""That's just another man's scolding,"" suggests the speaker is interpreting or assuming another person's scolding or criticism toward them. This indicates the speaker is attributing thoughts or intentions to someone else without direct evidence, which aligns with Mind Reading - assuming you know what others are thinking.",Mind Reading
2344,"Mom, this month's salary cuts, I'm gonna have to lay off for the next month. I'm not doing very well this year. This time I'll have to quit. What are we gonna do?","""this month's salary cuts,"" ""I'm gonna have to lay off for the next month,"" ""I'm not doing very well this year,"" ""This time I'll have to quit,"" ""What are we gonna do?""","The speaker interprets a current salary cut as a sign of continued failure throughout the year and an inevitable need to quit. This indicates a conclusion about the entirety of the year based on a single negative event, reflecting a broad, sweeping generalization. The phrase 'I'm not doing very well this year' following the immediate setback and 'This time I'll have to quit' reflect interpreting one event as indicative of an overall pattern. Therefore, the distortion stems from generalizing one negative circumstance into an overarching negative judgment.",Overgeneralization
2345,"I don't have a thing with them, so it's because I'm out of line.","""I don't have a thing with them"", ""so it's because I'm out of line""","The statement assumes a cause for the situation based purely on the speaker's interpretation of their own behavior or position ('I'm out of line') without direct evidence. The speaker takes the lack of conflict ('I don't have a thing with them') and immediately concludes the problem lies within themselves, suggesting self-blame without objective evidence. This reflects taking responsibility for events that may be outside their personal control, characterizing the distortion of Personalization.",Personalization
2346,"It's hard for the whole world to learn, to be tough, to be tough, to be alive.","""It's hard for the whole world to learn, to be tough, to be alive.""","The statement makes a broad claim about the entire world having difficulty with learning, toughness, and being alive. It generalizes the challenge to everyone without exception. This is an example of drawing a sweeping conclusion based on a limited or specific observation, fitting the definition of overgeneralization, which involves taking one instance or piece of evidence and applying it universally.",Overgeneralization
2347,It's my parents who've always wanted my best educational resources to help me study. I've dragged them down.,"""It's my parents who've always wanted my best educational resources to help me study."" and ""I've dragged them down.""","The speaker attributes their parents' desire for their educational success directly to their own perceived failure ('I've dragged them down'). This reflects taking personal responsibility for something that affects others, implying blame on oneself for external outcomes. The key cognitive distortion here is ""Personalization,"" where the individual assumes undue responsibility for negative experiences or events.",Personalization
2348,I want to grow up so I can run away from them.,"""I want to grow up so I can run away from them.""","The statement implies a desire to escape from certain people once the speaker is older, which suggests an assumption that growth (age) will enable escape. This reflects a future-oriented prediction without evidence, expecting a specific negative event (being with 'them') will continue and that running away is the solution. The focus is on anticipating and planning for a future scenario negatively, which aligns with Fortune-telling—predicting a negative outcome without sufficient evidence.",Fortune-telling
2349,They promised me to keep it secret. How can they be so angry and sad?,"""They promised me to keep it secret."" ""How can they be so angry and sad?""","The speaker assumes they know why others are angry and sad without explicit information from those others. This reflects making assumptions about others' mental states or feelings without evidence, which is characteristic of 'Mind Reading.' The statement questions the emotional reaction of others based on the speaker's own understanding, indicating an interpretation without confirmation.",Mind Reading
2350,"There is no way to do our business. The later we come to the company, the more we do.","""There is no way to do our business."" ""The later we come to the company, the more we do.""","The first phrase expresses a definitive negative conclusion—'no way to do our business'—implying an absolute impossibility without considering alternative solutions or perspectives. This reflects 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' by portraying the situation as completely hopeless. The second phrase supports this by implying increased effort is needed the later they arrive, which could reinforce extremes but mainly serves to justify the black-and-white viewpoint. There is no indication of emotional reasoning, fortune-telling about future outcomes, labeling, or other distortions. The key cognitive distortion is the absolute, rigid conclusion that no way exists to conduct the business.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2351,How can I face my parents if I don't get a good grade? They expect me so much to find a pit to bury themselves and never find out.,"""How can I face my parents if I don't get a good grade? They expect me so much to find a pit to bury themselves and never find out.""","The statement shows the speaker imagining a negative future outcome if they don't achieve a good grade, assuming that their parents' reaction will be extremely harsh and unforgiving. The speaker predicts a distressing scenario where the parents are so disappointed that it metaphorically suggests hiding forever. This reflects the cognitive distortion of 'Fortune-telling,' where the individual predicts a negative outcome without sufficient evidence and acts as if it is certain to happen.",Fortune-telling
2352,"When people have to be alone, I can have some fun for myself.","""When people have to be alone"", ""I can have some fun for myself""","The statement suggests that the speaker finds a positive or neutral experience (having fun alone) when others are alone. There is no evidence of exaggeration, negative prediction, or labeling. It expresses a straightforward observation or acceptance rather than a distorted thought. This does not reflect all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or other distortions listed. Instead, it appears to be a balanced thought.",No Distortion
2353,How could I do this to my parents? It's because I have nothing to do with my parents.,"""How could I do this to my parents?"" and ""It's because I have nothing to do with my parents.""","The first phrase conveys a self-critical emotional response indicating guilt or shame about actions towards the parents. The second phrase attributes the cause of the action to a personal factor related to the relationship with the parents. This reflects personalization, where the individual takes responsibility or blame for a situation by linking it directly to themselves without considering other factors. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or labeling; it is more about self-blame connected to personal involvement.",Personalization
2354,"It's his fault, it's because of what he did to get me to marry him, and I'll never get out of his control.","""It's his fault"", ""because of what he did to get me to marry him"", ""I'll never get out of his control.""","The statement shows blaming another person entirely for the situation, indicating an external locus of control. The phrase ""I'll never get out of his control"" reflects a prediction about the future without evidence, suggestive of assuming a negative outcome will definitely occur. This aligns most closely with 'Fortune-telling', where the speaker predicts an unavoidable negative future event based on current feelings or circumstances.",Fortune-telling
2355,I'm like an outsider in the house. I feel like I'm nothing to anyone.,"""I'm like an outsider in the house"", ""I feel like I'm nothing to anyone""","The statement implies that the speaker assumes they are not valued or included by anyone in the household, which suggests they are attributing thoughts or feelings to others without concrete evidence. This matches the concept of 'Mind Reading', where one believes they know what others think or feel about them. It is not 'Emotional Reasoning' because the statement is about others' supposed feelings toward the speaker, not the speaker's own feelings dictating reality. It is not 'Overgeneralization' because the statement does not generalize a single event to all situations but rather assumes the overall stance of others. Therefore, the best fit is 'Mind Reading'.",Mind Reading
2356,"I'm good at my job. I'm good at it, though I'm forced to do it.","""I'm good at my job"", ""I'm good at it, though I'm forced to do it""","The statement begins with a positive affirmation of ability—'I'm good at my job'—which shows a recognition of competence. However, the second part, 'though I'm forced to do it,' implies a negative external constraint that contradicts the positive regard. This suggests an acknowledgment of skill despite an external, negative circumstance rather than a cognitive distortion. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or other listed distortions. The speaker is clearly separating their ability from the external compulsion, not distorting reality or overgeneralizing.",No Distortion
2357,He thinks I'm useless. He can't treat the patient and calm the patient's emotions. He'll demoralize me soon.,"""He thinks I'm useless."" ""He can't treat the patient and calm the patient's emotions."" ""He'll demoralize me soon.""","The first phrase indicates an assumption about another person's thoughts without direct evidence, which aligns with Mind Reading. The second phrase is a factual critique but does not directly indicate a distortion. The third phrase predicts a negative future event ('He'll demoralize me soon.') without certainty, which is a classic example of Fortune-telling. However, the overall statement focuses on assumed thoughts and negative predictions about this person. Since the statement starts with 'He thinks I'm useless,' which is attributing negative thoughts to someone else, the dominant distortion here is Mind Reading.",Mind Reading
2358,I'm tired of it. It's not gonna work. Let it go.,"""It's not gonna work"", ""Let it go""","The phrase ""It's not gonna work"" predicts a negative outcome in the future without evidence, which corresponds to Fortune-telling. The speaker is assuming failure without certainty and deciding to give up preemptively. ""Let it go"" supports this resignation based on that prediction rather than objective assessment. The statement does not reflect all-or-nothing thinking because there's no extreme binary evaluation of success vs. failure here, just a negative future forecast leading to quitting.",Fortune-telling
2359,I'm a bad job worker who can only work overtime.,"""I'm a bad job worker""; ""can only work overtime""","The statement uses a global negative label ""bad job worker"" applied to the entire self based on the situation described. This shows an extreme labeling of self-worth rooted in perceived job performance. The phrase ""can only work overtime"" further supports a limiting, negative self-assessment generalized to the whole job role. Therefore, this matches the cognitive distortion of labeling, where a person assigns a fixed, negative label to themselves.",Labeling
2360,"Insomnia happens at night, and there may be something wrong with my body.","Insomnia happens at night, and there may be something wrong with my body.","The statement identifies the occurrence of insomnia specifically at night (a fact), then leaps to a conclusion that 'there may be something wrong with my body,' which involves making an assumption based on current physical symptoms. This reflects emotional reasoning, where the feeling or symptom (insomnia) is used as evidence that something must be physically wrong, rather than considering alternative explanations or additional evidence.",Emotional Reasoning
2361,"Can't you play cell phones? What's the point of my life? I have to play games, I have to brush video, or I'll die.","""What's the point of my life?"", ""I have to play games, I have to brush video, or I'll die.""","The statement ""What's the point of my life?"" reflects an extreme, all-encompassing negative judgment. The phrase ""I have to play games, I have to brush video, or I'll die"" indicates a rigid, black-and-white thinking—if these actions are not done, catastrophic consequences will follow. This suggests a pattern where the person views situations in absolute terms without recognizing any middle ground or nuance.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2362,"I don't like Beijing, but my parents love Beijing. I'm upset.","""I don't like Beijing"", ""my parents love Beijing"", ""I'm upset""","The statement presents a contrast between the speaker's dislike of Beijing and the parents' love for it, followed by the speaker's upset feeling. The upset may stem from assuming that the parents' positive feeling about Beijing somehow invalidates their own feelings or implies a conflict. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the speaker feels upset and interprets that feeling as evidence of a problem or conflict. There is no clear evidence of absolute thinking, fortune-telling, blaming, or other distortions.",Emotional Reasoning
2363,I said why the neighborhood always looked at me like that. They must have looked at me like that because I was adopted.,The neighborhood always looked at me like that; They must have looked at me like that because I was adopted.,"The statement assumes the cause of others' behavior without evidence, attributing their looks specifically to the fact of being adopted. This is a classic case of mind reading, where the individual presumes to know the thoughts or feelings of others without confirmation.",Mind Reading
2364,"I'm afraid, expressing myself in front of others is terrible, and I can't improve my ability to express myself.","""expressing myself in front of others is terrible"" and ""I can't improve my ability to express myself.""","The statement includes a dichotomous judgment where the speaker sees their expression ability as 'terrible' with no possibility of improvement, reflecting a rigid and absolute view. This reflects a black-and-white approach without acknowledging any middle ground or potential for change, which matches the characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2365,Did someone say something against us behind my back?,Did someone say something against us behind my back?,"The statement assumes that someone has spoken negatively about 'us' without any evidence. The speaker is presuming knowledge of others' thoughts or actions without confirmation. This reflects an attempt to infer others' intentions or behaviors without direct proof, which aligns with the distortion of assuming to know what others are thinking or doing behind one's back.",Mind Reading
2366,How could I hurt my parents like that? I'm a son of a bitch.,"""How could I hurt my parents like that?"", ""I'm a son of a bitch.""","The first phrase expresses guilt and self-blame for hurting parents, suggesting personal responsibility for an event. The second phrase is a negative, harsh self-label indicating global self-judgment based on this incident. This reflects the distortion of 'Labeling', where one assigns a negative label to oneself instead of focusing on specific behavior or situation.",Labeling
2367,"My little baby doesn't know how hard it is for me, so don't give birth.","""My little baby doesn't know how hard it is for me"", ""so don't give birth""","The statement assumes knowledge about the baby's awareness or feelings (i.e., that the baby 'doesn't know how hard it is for me'), which is an attribution of thoughts or knowledge to another person without evidence. This is a classic example of Mind Reading, where one presumes to understand what others think or feel. Additionally, the statement uses this presumed understanding to make a strong recommendation or judgment ('so don't give birth'), but the primary distortion is the presumption about the baby's knowledge, not the prescription itself.",Mind Reading
2368,"Pain seems to be destined to accompany me throughout my life, and I feel controlled by pain, and I can't get rid of it.","""Pain seems to be destined to accompany me throughout my life"", ""I feel controlled by pain"", ""I can't get rid of it.""","The statement suggests a belief that pain will inevitably persist indefinitely (""destined to accompany me throughout my life""), which reflects a prediction about future events without concrete evidence, matching Fortune-telling. The phrase ""I feel controlled by pain"" is more about emotional state but does not alone constitute Emotional Reasoning. The overall emphasis on inevitable, unchanging future suffering aligns most closely with Fortune-telling, as the speaker is predicting a negative outcome as certain.",Fortune-telling
2369,"My unique character makes him uncomfortable, and I should pay more attention to his feelings, which I caused.","""My unique character makes him uncomfortable"", ""I should pay more attention to his feelings"", ""which I caused""","The statement reflects a belief that the speaker is responsible for the other person's discomfort ('which I caused'), indicating a personalized interpretation of events. The phrase 'I should pay more attention' indicates a 'should statement,' expressing expectations of how the speaker ought to behave. However, the key distortion is the assumption of causation and responsibility ('which I caused'), which aligns with Personalization, where one assumes undue responsibility for another's feelings or events. While 'should statements' are present, the core distortion is Personalization, as it drives the emotional reasoning and behavioral implications.",Personalization
2370,I can't stand arguing with my roommate every day! I'm going to get a new room!,"""I can't stand arguing with my roommate every day!"", ""I'm going to get a new room!""","The key phrase 'arguing with my roommate every day' implies a repetitive negative experience, which suggests a pattern is being perceived as consistent and unchanging. The phrase 'I can't stand' indicates strong emotional distress. The decision to 'get a new room' appears to be a direct response to the ongoing conflict, indicating an immediate solution without considering other possible outcomes or resolutions. This reflects an 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' distortion, where the individual sees the situation in extremes (constant arguing, and the only solution is moving out), rather than considering a range of possibilities or partial solutions.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2371,"I've been fat all my life, I can't lose weight and control myself, and I've been ugly all my life.","""I've been fat all my life"", ""I can't lose weight and control myself"", ""I've been ugly all my life""","The statement takes specific experiences (being overweight and feeling unattractive) and generalizes them across the entire lifespan using phrases like ""all my life."" This suggests the person is drawing a broad conclusion based on limited evidence or ongoing struggles, indicating an overgeneralization distortion. The statement does not reflect thinking in terms of absolutes (All-or-Nothing), nor does it appear to be solely based on feelings without evidence (Emotional Reasoning), or predicting future outcomes (Fortune-telling). Labeling could be considered due to the use of ""fat"" and ""ugly,"" but the emphasis on the lifelong pattern and inability to control suggests the dominant distortion is overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2372,"All my friends over the years don't care about me, even you don't care about me.","All my friends over the years don't care about me, even you don't care about me.","The statement takes the specific experiences with some friends and one person ('you') and extends this to a broad, sweeping generalization that 'all' friends over the years don't care. This represents a pattern of taking a few instances and applying them universally without sufficient evidence, which fits the definition of overgeneralization. It is not simply seeing things in black-and-white terms (all-or-nothing), as the focus is on a widespread assumption rather than an absolute good/bad dichotomy. It is also not mind reading, as the speaker is not assuming to know the other's thoughts but concluding a lack of care based on their experiences.",Overgeneralization

The phrase ""It is too difficult to face the death of a loved one"" indicates that the speaker is basing their belief about the world largely on how they feel emotionally, rather than objective evidence. This reliance on feelings—particularly fear and distress—to draw conclusions about reality is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning. There is also an element of catastrophic thinking about separation and solitude, but the core cognitive distortion is the assumption that because they feel unable to cope, the situation must be unbearable or impossible.",Emotional Reasoning
2374,"I am ugly, and no more sport can really improve that.","""I am ugly"", ""no more sport can really improve that""","The statement includes a global negative self-assessment ""I am ugly"" which categorizes the speaker's entire appearance negatively and definitively. This reflects the distortion type of Labeling, as the speaker is assigning a negative label to themselves. Additionally, the phrase ""no more sport can really improve that"" suggests a belief that no effort or action can change this fixed negative trait, reinforcing the labeled identity rather than seeing it as modifiable. The primary distortion is Labeling rather than other distortions because the focus is on categorizing oneself with a negative label.",Labeling

""I can't get used to it.""","The statement assumes a negative outcome (dizziness) will definitely happen if the person works, without sufficient evidence—predicting the future negatively. This aligns with Fortune-telling, where one predicts a bad outcome as a certainty. The person does not consider other possibilities or that they might adapt over time.",Fortune-telling
2376,"People I know may like me at the beginning, but over time they may not want to be with me anymore.","People I know may like me at the beginning, but over time they may not want to be with me anymore.","The statement predicts a negative future outcome (people not wanting to be with the speaker over time) without concrete evidence. It involves assuming what will happen in the future based on current feelings or perceptions. This aligns with 'Fortune-telling,' which is the cognitive distortion of predicting future negative events without sufficient basis.",Fortune-telling
2377,"If I eat one more bite, I'll be completely deformed as a pig.","""If I eat one more bite"", ""I'll be completely deformed as a pig""","The statement exaggerates the consequences of a small action (eating one more bite) into something extremely negative and unrealistic (being completely deformed as a pig). This reflects an exaggeration of the negative outcome far beyond the actual impact. This is typical of Magnification, where one amplifies the negative aspects or outcomes disproportionately.",Magnification
2378,I'm a mentally insomniatic person.,"""I'm a mentally insomniatic person.""","The statement attributes a fixed identity to the speaker ('mentally insomniatic person'), which is a global and negative label based on their experience with insomnia. This reflects labeling, where a person assigning a negative and broad label to themselves based on a specific trait or experience, rather than seeing the behavior as situational or changeable.",Labeling
2379,"When my father was unable to accept me, I felt that the path to the future was like a dead end in darkness.","""path to the future was like a dead end in darkness""","The statement expresses a negative and absolute prediction about the future based on the current experience of rejection from the father. The phrase 'path to the future was like a dead end in darkness' shows that the person is assuming that nothing positive or hopeful lies ahead, which is a classic example of predicting a negative outcome without sufficient evidence. This aligns with the definition of 'Fortune-telling,' where one expects a negative future event as if it is already certain.",Fortune-telling

This reflects an assumption about future motivation or behavior based on current feeling, implying a prediction about their own capacity to engage due to present emotional state. This is a form of predicting a negative outcome (not engaging because of laziness) without enough evidence, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling' — predicting the future negatively based solely on current feelings or assumptions.",Fortune-telling

This reflects a form of predicting or assuming future events/outcomes negatively without realistic basis, which aligns with Fortune-telling. It is not generalizing beyond this situation, nor is it an emotional justification or labeling a person or self. It also does not express absolutes as All-or-Nothing Thinking would, nor does it filter or personalize the event beyond the bad luck assumption.",Fortune-telling

2386,Living with your husband isn't with your mother-in-law.,Living with your husband isn't with your mother-in-law,"The statement distinguishes between two different living situations, emphasizing a stark difference. However, it does not show an extreme 'all or nothing' judgment, but rather a factual comparison. There is no evidence of assuming negative outcomes (fortune-telling), emotional influence on reasoning, or labeling people. It is presented as a straightforward contrast without overgeneralization or personalization. Thus, the statement does not reflect a cognitive distortion as it simply points out a factual difference.",No Distortion

It's a dead dog who bites people!,"""There's not a good dog in the world""; ""It's bad luck""; ""It's a dead dog who bites people""","The statement generalizes the negative experience with a dog to all dogs, implying none are good. It also attributes the cause to 'bad luck,' which suggests an expectation of negative outcomes in future situations (fortune-telling). The phrase 'It's a dead dog who bites people' adds an exaggerated negative view, but the core distortion lies in the absolute generalization 'not a good dog in the world.' This is a classic example of overgeneralization, where one event or few instances are used to make a sweeping conclusion about an entire category.",Overgeneralization

There is no indication of exaggerated negative thinking, all-encompassing negative conclusions, predictions about the future, or labeling self or others. Instead, the speaker connects the action directly to feelings of grief, which is an example of Emotional Reasoning—assuming that feelings reflect objective reality or guide behavior. The references to past desires (‘we've always wanted to do’) and the present act are narrative but not distorted cognitively. Therefore, the dominant distortion is Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

The phrase ""He just doesn't tell me"" suggests the speaker believes they know the other person's hidden thoughts. The conclusion ""He really hates me"" is a definitive negative judgment about the other person based solely on perceived anger. This fits the cognitive distortion of Mind Reading, where one assumes they know the thoughts and feelings of others without concrete proof.",Mind Reading
2392,People don't understand. I don't mean everyone doesn't understand me. People don't understand me.,People don't understand. I don't mean everyone doesn't understand me. People don't understand me.,"The speaker first states a broad claim that 'People don't understand' and then clarifies that it does not mean 'everyone' but reiterates that 'People don't understand me.' This indicates an assumption about others' thoughts or feelings without evidence (assuming people don't understand their perspective).

It assumes a negative outcome for the entire project in the future without clear evidence, reflecting a prediction about future failure. This is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling', as the person is foreseeing a negative outcome as inevitable. It is not 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' because the focus is on prediction rather than viewing things in absolute terms. It is not 'Emotional Reasoning' because the statement is declarative about the future, not based solely on feelings. Therefore, the best fit is 'Fortune-telling'.",Fortune-telling

Phrases like 'there's no hope', 'there's no chance', and 'that's all I've ever done' suggest that the speaker believes their situation will never improve and that this negative state is permanent and universal. This fits the description of Overgeneralization, where one or two negative events or feelings are extended to infinite negative outcomes.",Overgeneralization

This reflects predicting a negative outcome (being put in a mental hospital) without evidence. Therefore, the main distortion is about assuming a future event will occur based on fears rather than certainty.",Fortune-telling
2398,"It is my own responsibility to fail to make progress as planned, and the teachers are equally looking forward to me.","It is my own responsibility to fail to make progress as planned, and the teachers are equally looking forward to me.","The statement assigns full responsibility for failure solely to the individual, indicating a personalized view of the situation. Additionally, it assumes what the teachers feel or expect ('teachers are equally looking forward to me'), which reflects making assumptions about others' thoughts or feelings without evidence. However, since the statement centers on personal responsibility and the expected reaction of teachers, the core distortion is 'Personalization'—taking undue responsibility for negative outcomes. The mention of teachers' attitudes aligns with 'Mind Reading,' but the primary focus is on self-blame and personal responsibility. Therefore, Personalization best fits.",Personalization

It's a mess.,"""What's wrong with me?"" and ""It's a mess.""","The phrase ""What's wrong with me?"" implies that the speaker believes there is a fundamental flaw or problem within themselves. ""It's a mess."" suggests a negative global label about their condition or situation. This reflects the distortion known as ""Labeling,"" where a person assigns a negative and overly broad label to themselves or their circumstances based on perceived faults or failures, rather than specific behaviors or situations. The statement does not explicitly show extremes (all-or-nothing), predictions (fortune-telling), or other distortions.",Labeling

2401,I'm a bad kid. No one cares. Incompetence and incompetence.,"""I'm a bad kid"", ""No one cares"", ""Incompetence and incompetence""","The phrase ""I'm a bad kid"" is a broad and negative self-assessment that categorizes the speaker completely and negatively, indicating a harsh label being applied to oneself. ""No one cares"" also generalizes the behavior or feelings of others in an absolute sense. The repetition of ""Incompetence and incompetence"" emphasizes a strong negative judgment about abilities. Among the given distortion types, Labeling involves assigning a negative and overly simplistic label to oneself or others, which aligns with calling oneself ""bad."" While there are elements of overgeneralization in ""No one cares,"" the central theme is the negative label about the self.",Labeling
2402,I can't solve my parents' problems. I'm not good at anything.,"""I can't solve my parents' problems."" and ""I'm not good at anything.""","The statement contains two parts. First, ""I can't solve my parents' problems"" reflects a personal responsibility or failure. The second part, ""I'm not good at anything,"" is a broad, sweeping conclusion about the self. This is a classic example of overgeneralization, where a single perceived failure or difficulty is generalized to the entire self-worth or ability. The person concludes they are globally deficient based on limited evidence. This is not All-or-Nothing Thinking since it doesn't reflect a dichotomy, nor is it emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, or any other distortion listed.",Overgeneralization

This is a classic example of Fortune-telling, where an individual predicts negative future events as certain. Additionally, the phrase 'no hope' reflects a hopeless expectation. The statement does not reflect an absolute dichotomy (All-or-Nothing), a generalized pattern from a single event (Overgeneralization), or labeling oneself or others. It is primarily about forecasting negative and immutable future events.",Fortune-telling

I'm tired of losing like a loser.","""I'm tired of trying, but I see few results."" and ""I'm tired of losing like a loser.""","The speaker expresses frustration with perceived lack of success despite effort and calls themselves a ""loser."" This shows a negative global judgment about self based on current setbacks. The phrase ""losing like a loser"" applies a negative label to the self, which aligns specifically with the cognitive distortion of Labeling. Although there is an element of overgeneralization in feeling consistently unsuccessful, the dominant distortion is the application of a negative identity label rather than a broader overly generalized conclusion or another distortion.",Labeling
2405,I'm not being nice enough for a roommate to sneak up on a roll and don't call me that.,"""I'm not being nice enough"", ""a roommate to sneak up on a roll"", ""don't call me that""","The phrase ""I'm not being nice enough"" indicates self-judgment about personal behavior, potentially a negative evaluation. The part ""a roommate to sneak up on a roll"" is unclear but may imply a perception or assumption about others' behavior. ""Don't call me that"" suggests sensitivity to labels or names. Overall, the self-criticism in ""I'm not being nice enough"" suggests an internal demand or expectation about how one should behave. This fits with 'Should statements,' where the individual imposes expectations on themselves, leading to emotional distress or self-criticism.",Should statements
2406,Now even my best friend can not say a word. Will everyone ever do that?,"""Now even my best friend can not say a word. Will everyone ever do that?""","The statement observes that the speaker's best friend is silent and then immediately generalizes this specific instance to imply that everyone else will behave in the same way. This is a classic overgeneralization pattern where a single example is expanded to encompass all others (in this case, all people). The statement is not predicting the future with certainty (fortune-telling), nor is it assuming others' thoughts (mind reading). It also does not reflect polarized thinking, exaggerated importance, or self-blame. Therefore, the dominant cognitive distortion is likely Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2407,It's gonna cost me a lot of money. My family's gonna think I'm a liability.,"""My family's gonna think I'm a liability.""","The statement predicts how others (family) will perceive the speaker without any evidence, assuming that the family will definitely think negatively. This shows the speaker is making assumptions about others' thoughts, which is characteristic of Mind Reading. Other parts of the statement (e.g., expecting cost) do not involve evidence-free assumptions about the future or emotions, so the focus is on the comment about the family's presumed thoughts.",Mind Reading
2408,The investment failed. I have nothing. I lost everything. I can't live anymore.,"""The investment failed. I have nothing. I lost everything. I can't live anymore.""","The statement starts with a specific event (investment failed), then quickly generalizes this failure to an absolute total loss ('I have nothing,' 'I lost everything'). It escalates the negative outcome beyond the event itself into an extreme conclusion about one's ability to live ('I can't live anymore'). This suggests a black-and-white view with no middle ground or consideration of partial success, other assets, or alternative solutions. This pattern aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking, where outcomes are seen as total success or total failure, with no nuance.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

That's why I'm being treated like this.,"""I should have asked him why I was being targeted"", ""He was jealous"", ""That's why I'm being treated like this""","The phrase 'I should have asked him...' indicates the use of 'should' which is typical of 'Should statements' distortion. This involves setting rigid rules or expectations about how one or others must behave. Additionally, the statement ""He was jealous. That's why I'm being treated like this"" attributes the cause of the treatment to the other's jealousy without concrete evidence, which could suggest personalization or mind reading. However, the most explicit distortion is the use of the word 'should,' reflecting an internal demand or expectation that the speaker failed to meet. Thus, the primary distortion is 'Should statements.'",Should statements

I'll be alone.","""I don't know anyone here"", ""I don't have friends"", ""I'll be alone""","The speaker concludes that because they don't know anyone currently, they have no friends at all, and therefore they will be alone. This reflects taking a specific situation (not knowing anyone in a particular place) and generalizing it broadly about their social connections and future state of being alone. The statement generalizes from one event to an absolute condition, which fits the distortion of Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

There is no indication of absolute extremes (all-or-nothing), labeling, overgeneralizing, or fortune-telling specific negative outcomes beyond a general concern. The statement reflects a realistic expression of preference and concern rather than a cognitive distortion based on irrational thought patterns or assumptions about the future or others' thoughts. Therefore, it does not fit any distortion such as fortune-telling, mind reading, or emotional reasoning.",No Distortion

2414,I don't know what to do for the rest of my life.,I don't know what to do for the rest of my life.,"The statement reflects a negative prediction about the future without evidence, implying a belief that they will remain uncertain indefinitely. This resembles Fortune-telling, where one predicts negative outcomes without factual basis. It is not All-or-Nothing Thinking, because the person is not thinking in absolutes, nor is it Emotional Reasoning, as the statement does not hinge on feelings as proof. The key element is the unsubstantiated forecasting of a lifelong state.",Fortune-telling

2416,"I went to the most famous hospital in our province without finding out what the problem was, and I felt devastated and desperate, and there was no cure for my illness.","I felt devastated and desperate, and there was no cure for my illness.","The statement links the speaker's emotional state ('felt devastated and desperate') as direct evidence that there was no cure for their illness. The person is using their emotional response to conclude the factual situation about the illness without relying on objective evidence. This is the definition of Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are interpreted as reality.",Emotional Reasoning
2417,My feet are cramped. I can't swim anymore. I'm sorry.,"""My feet are cramped. I can't swim anymore. I'm sorry.""","The statement expresses a specific physical condition (cramped feet) followed by a definitive, negative conclusion about an ability ('I can't swim anymore'). This conclusion goes beyond the immediate circumstance and assumes a permanent inability to swim based on one instance of discomfort. This reflects an overgeneralization, where one event is used to make a broad and absolute judgment about one's capabilities. The phrase 'I'm sorry' indicates emotional distress, but the primary distortion is the sweeping conclusion from a single incident.",Overgeneralization

This reflects a broad conclusion based on a single aspect or belief without considering exceptions or other outcomes. It also disregards any positive aspects or potential success in love, thus extending one negative experience or belief to all scenarios. These characteristics align closely with overgeneralization, where one negative event or feeling is taken to represent an unchanging and all-encompassing reality.",Overgeneralization

The use of 'always' indicates a sweeping conclusion based on limited evidence, which reflects an overgeneralization. Additionally, the phrase 'it was hopeless' amplifies the negativity and finality of the situation, reinforcing the pervasive negative conclusion. However, the core distortion is the extrapolation from one or a few instances to a universal pattern, which aligns directly with the Overgeneralization distortion.",Overgeneralization

This reflects a form of 'should' or 'must' thinking, where the speaker imposes a high expectation or moral obligation on themselves. The statement does not display black-and-white thinking, fortune-telling, or labeling.

""I've ruined everything"" is an absolute negative conclusion about past actions, suggesting overgeneralization. However, the strongest distortion is the prediction of future failure without basis, which is a classic sign of fortune-telling rather than simple overgeneralization or magnification.

This indicates that the distress is based on their feelings rather than objective evidence of harm.

The following phrase ""Let me drive it so hard"" indicates an intention to possibly treat the car roughly or in a self-punishing way. This suggests a distorted thinking pattern involving personal responsibility or blame. However, the statement does not reflect categorical thinking (All-or-Nothing), assuming feelings equate to facts (Emotional Reasoning), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), assigning labels (Labeling), exaggerating importance (Magnification), focusing on a single negative detail (Mental filter), assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading), making broad generalizations (Overgeneralization), or setting rigid rules (Should statements).

It attributes a universal negative intention to 'all the capital' and presents a bleak, deterministic outcome where only the owners benefit while workers suffer endlessly. These generalizations apply a sweeping negative conclusion to an entire group and situation based on limited or selective evidence, which goes beyond a specific case to an all-encompassing judgment about society and capital owners.

There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or mind reading here. The speaker is not interpreting emotions as facts (emotional reasoning), nor exaggerating or filtering details.

The latter part, ""I'm not fit to eat, so I'll starve to death,"" represents a catastrophic prediction, but mainly it reflects an extreme conclusion drawn from a perceived personal flaw. Between the two, the predominant distortion is overgeneralization because the speaker generalizes the feeling of annoyance to a constant experience. The catastrophic statement suggests magnification, but the primary cognitive distortion underlying the sentence is overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

I'm useless.,'Even bubble noodles can get burned in the hand.' and 'I'm useless.',"The phrase 'Even bubble noodles can get burned in the hand.' illustrates a minor mistake or accident, suggesting the possibility of failure despite simplicity. The second phrase 'I'm useless.' makes a global negative judgment about the self based on that single incident. This shows overgeneralization—drawing a broad conclusion ('I'm useless') from a specific event (burning the noodles). It also resembles labeling, but labeling would typically involve affixing a negative global trait without context, whereas here the negative label is drawn as a conclusion from the event, fitting overgeneralization more precisely.",Overgeneralization

This aligns with fortune-telling, where one predicts future events negatively. The phrase ""My short life is so dark"" emphasizes a global negative view, but the dominant distortion is the unwarranted negative prediction about the future. Although there is an element of emotional reasoning (feeling hopeless leading to assuming no hope), the core distortion is the negative certainty about the future, which fits 'Fortune-telling' best.",Fortune-telling

The phrase 'I'm not fit to be with someone else' is a global, negative judgment about the self, which resembles labeling. Labeling is assigning a fixed, negative identity to oneself. Although there is some element of comparison, the core distortion lies in the self-labeling as 'not fit'. It is not all-or-nothing thinking since the statement focuses on a fixed negative identity rather than extremes. There is no explicit emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, or mind reading.

This indicates a broad and negative conclusion about the future and self, based on limited experience. The phrase 'I'm probably gonna be like this all the time' reflects a generalization from repeated failures to an unchanging permanent condition.

2452,"My closest friend betrayed me, and I felt the sky falling.","""My closest friend betrayed me"", ""I felt the sky falling""","The phrase ""My closest friend betrayed me"" describes a specific negative event. The subsequent feeling of ""the sky falling"" suggests the individual is interpreting the emotional experience as evidence of a catastrophic reality. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are treated as facts. Although the expression is dramatic, it stems from an emotional response rather than an objective assessment. There is no indication of All-or-Nothing Thinking because the statement does not imply absolute terms like ""always"" or ""never."" It is not Fortune-telling as there is no prediction about the future. Labeling is absent since no global negative label is applied to the self or others.

The next part ""When my bones are broken, you must repay them"" introduces a rigid demand or expectation about what others must do in response to personal harm or suffering. This phrase reflects a belief in how others should behave, indicating a form of moral imperative or obligation.

The phrase 'It's too hard for me to love myself' reflects a harsh, global negative view of the self. This suggests the person is viewing the situation and themselves in absolutes without middle ground, indicating a black-and-white perspective rather than a balanced view. These elements point to 'All-or-Nothing Thinking', where the person perceives their circumstances and self-worth in extremely negative, absolute terms.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The phrase 'I know that people like me are wrong' applies a broad negative label to a group that includes the speaker, which is characteristic of the labeling distortion. Labeling involves assigning a negative stereotype or identity to oneself or others based on behavior or traits, rather than seeing specific actions or situations. Here, the speaker labels their group as inherently 'wrong,' indicating a fixed, negative identity judgment.",Labeling

However, ""I think I'm gonna fail"" reflects a prediction about the future failure without evidence, based solely on the speaker's current feelings or thoughts. This fits the pattern of Fortune-telling, where the person anticipates a negative outcome without certainty. It is not All-or-Nothing thinking because there's no absolute success/failure dichotomy stated, nor is it Emotional Reasoning because the statement is about what the person believes will happen, not purely how they feel.

""I'm always wrong after all.""","The phrase ""I'm always wrong after all"" reflects an overgeneralization because the word ""always"" implies that the speaker believes they are wrong in every situation, without exception. This is a broad and absolute conclusion based on presumably limited experiences. The fear of talking to people stems from this negative sweeping judgment. Although ""I'm really scared to talk to people"" suggests emotional reasoning, the core distortion driving the fear is the overgeneralization of being ""always wrong.""",Overgeneralization

This reflects an assumption that the negative event (being sick) was a sign or cause of bad luck, which aligns with interpreting feelings or situations as evidence of a negative reality. This reasoning best fits 'Emotional Reasoning,' where the person concludes that because they feel bad luck, it must be true, rather than it being a neutral event or just an illness.

The second part, 'I should have shared my life with them more,' contains a 'should' statement, implying a self-imposed rule or expectation about past behavior. However, since the instruction is to classify the sentence into ONE cognitive distortion, the dominant element is the 'should' statement expressing regret and perceived failure to meet a standard, which is the classic form of 'Should statements'. The reference to others' intentions is tentative ('probably'), reducing the certainty that defines Mind Reading.

The speaker attributes failure to themselves without considering external factors, implying they are the cause of the disappointment. It focuses on self-blame in relation to others' beliefs and expectations. This aligns with the distortion where an individual takes excessive responsibility for events, interpreting them as their fault, which matches the definition of 'Personalization'.

The phrase ""He doesn't usually look down on us workers"" is a neutral or slightly positive statement. The expression ""Now he's smoking our blood in plain sight!"" is a metaphorical exaggeration indicating harm or exploitation, representing magnification but is tied to the initial assumption.

This aligns with the distortion type ""Fortune-telling,"" where the individual predicts or assumes the cause or outcome without certainty. The latter part, ""Just take a few more days off and give myself a little vacation,"" is a proposed solution and does not indicate cognitive distortion.

This reflects a broad conclusion about future situations based on current circumstances without considering change or variability. The focus on permanence and future inevitability aligns with the distortion where a general rule is created from a limited sample.

The instruction to ""Don't look in the mirror anymore"" suggests a complete avoidance due to this negative self-evaluation. This reflects an absolute way of thinking about their looks with no middle ground or consideration of any positive attributes.

The speaker assumes the person deliberately stole their work silently, attributing intentions without confirmation. The second phrase ""It's so frustrating, it's boring to work"" reflects an emotional response but does not directly contribute to a distortion type.

There is also labeling present in the phrase 'incompetent parents', which is a global negative judgment. Additionally, the speaker concludes 'I don't deserve to be a parent', reflecting a harsh negative evaluation of self-worth. Among these, the most dominant distortion is labeling due to the direct name-calling ('incompetent parents') and implied judgment ('do they have parents?'). Overgeneralization is present but less central than the label. Therefore, the best fitting distortion is Labeling.",Labeling

There is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, mind reading, or personalization here. The statement is not about what others think or predicting the future but about self-labeling.

The prediction ""I'll be filled with regret"" involves forecasting a negative future emotional state without evidence.

The statement ""He's picky"" generalizes the boss's behavior to justify the perception of targeting. This aligns with Mind Reading, where one assumes knowledge of another person's thoughts or intentions. It is not Fortune-telling since no future outcome is predicted; it is not Emotional Reasoning because the statement is about the boss's behavior, not the speaker's feelings; it is not Overgeneralization or Labeling.

It is a realistic contemplation of what one would do if the constraint (time) were removed.",No Distortion
2534,There's nothing I can do about it. It's not gonna work.,"""There's nothing I can do about it."" and ""It's not gonna work.""","The statement expresses a pessimistic prediction that the outcome will be unsuccessful without considering other possible outcomes or efforts. The phrase ""It's not gonna work"" is a definitive prediction about the future without evidence, fitting the definition of Fortune-telling where one assumes a negative future event will occur. The claim ""There's nothing I can do about it"" reinforces this by indicating a sense of helplessness without exploring alternatives. Therefore, the cognitive distortion primarily involves making a negative prediction about the future.",Fortune-telling
2535,Someone must have bothered me. They couldn't see me well.,"""Someone must have bothered me."" ""They couldn't see me well.""","The phrase ""Someone must have bothered me"" implies a guess or assumption about another person's thoughts or intentions without clear evidence, which aligns with predicting or assuming what others are thinking or feeling. This fits the definition of Mind Reading. The additional phrase ""They couldn't see me well"" might be an attempt to justify the assumption but does not change the cognitive distortion type. Therefore, the statement is an example of Mind Reading, making an assumption about others' mental states.",Mind Reading
2536,What are these guards doing? How can they put such animals in here? Security guards are useless!,"""How can they put such animals in here? Security guards are useless!""","The speaker attributes a negative global label to the security guards based on a specific incident involving their perceived failure or mistake. Instead of describing a specific behavior, they call the guards ""useless,"" which is a character-based judgment. This fits the cognitive distortion of 'Labeling,' where a person assigns a negative label to themselves or others based on isolated events.",Labeling
2537,God only wants to punish me if I don't like it.,"""God only wants to punish me if I don't like it""","The statement assumes the intention or desire of God without any evidence, specifically that God wants to punish the speaker based on their feelings. This reflects an assumption about another's mental state or intentions (here, God), which aligns with 'Mind Reading,' where one infers what others are thinking or feeling without confirmation.",Mind Reading
2538,I'm sure it's my fault I don't have any contact with my family. I should've taken the initiative forever.,"""I'm sure it's my fault"", ""I should've taken the initiative forever""","The statement blames oneself for the lack of contact with the family, indicating a personalization distortion by attributing the cause of a complex relational issue solely to oneself. Additionally, the phrase ""I should've taken the initiative forever"" clearly reflects 'should statements' by imposing a rigid rule on past behavior and expressing regret or self-criticism for not meeting that expectation. Between these, 'should statements' stands out as the primary distortion because it explicitly uses 'should've' to criticize past actions, which is central to the thought.",Should statements
2539,"Well, we'll just have to start over, but it'll be a lot faster this time.","we'll just have to start over, but it'll be a lot faster this time","The statement acknowledges a potential setback ('start over') but frames it in a positive and realistic way ('it'll be a lot faster this time'). There is no evidence of extreme or distorted thinking such as catastrophizing or negative predictions. The speaker does not jump to conclusions, overly generalize, or make unfounded assumptions about others' thoughts or feelings. Instead, the statement shows acceptance and constructive optimism without irrational or distorted cognition.",No Distortion
2540,What am I gonna do? I can't tell my parents. They're gonna say it indiscriminately. They're gonna say it.,I can't tell my parents. They're gonna say it indiscriminately. They're gonna say it.,"The speaker assumes that if they tell their parents, the parents will react in a specific negative way (saying it indiscriminately) without any actual evidence provided. This is predicting the future and assuming a negative outcome based on their thoughts rather than facts. This aligns closely with the cognitive distortion of Fortune-telling, where one expects negative outcomes without sufficient evidence.",Fortune-telling
2541,Back pain. I'm sure there's a spinal problem. I'm sure it'll turn into a vegetable.,"""I'm sure there's a spinal problem."" ""I'm sure it'll turn into a vegetable.""","The individual is predicting a negative outcome (becoming a vegetable) with absolute certainty without sufficient evidence. This reflects making a negative prediction about the future. The key feature is predicting a negative event with certainty, which aligns with Fortune-telling. Although there is some emotional influence, the main distortion is focusing on predicting a catastrophic future.",Fortune-telling
2542,I'm so far away from what I was meant to be. It's frustrating. The essence of life is to follow the tide.,"""I'm so far away from what I was meant to be""; ""The essence of life is to follow the tide.""","The statement ""I'm so far away from what I was meant to be"" suggests a fixed, absolute evaluation of the self, implying a sense of failure or inadequacy without nuance—indicating 'all-or-nothing thinking.' The phrase ""The essence of life is to follow the tide"" reflects a broad, potentially resigned generalization about life’s purpose. However, the primary cognitive distortion appears in the absolute judgment about the self, which aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking rather than other distortions like Emotional Reasoning or Overgeneralization. There is no explicit evidence of emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2543,Why is she so lazy? She doesn't do any domestic work. A woman who doesn't do domestic work is not a worthy wife.,"""she so lazy"", ""doesn't do any domestic work"", ""A woman who doesn't do domestic work is not a worthy wife""","The statement labels the woman as 'lazy' based on her behavior of not doing domestic work, which is a direct application of a negative label to a person without considering other factors. Additionally, the sentence generalizes a judgment about all women who don't do domestic work, calling them 'not worthy wives,' which further supports the presence of labeling. This is not simply an all-or-nothing thinking since it focuses on labeling the person rather than seeing situations in black-or-white terms. It is not emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, or mind reading, as it doesn't infer feelings or predict the future. The statement is clearly assigning a negative label based on a behavior, aligning best with the cognitive distortion known as Labeling.",Labeling
2544,"I'm an unfortunate man, starting a company is a loss to me.","""I'm an unfortunate man"", ""starting a company is a loss to me""","The statement labels the speaker as 'unfortunate' based on their experience with starting a company, which they immediately see as a loss. This reflects a negative global label applied to themselves. Additionally, it involves a negative personal evaluation rather than considering specific circumstances or possibilities that might differ. It does not merely indicate an either/or perspective (All-or-Nothing), nor is it predicting the future (Fortune-telling). It is not about interpreting others’ thoughts (Mind Reading), filtering out positives (Mental filter), or involving 'should' statements. Hence, the primary distortion is applying a negative label to the self based on the situation.",Labeling

""Think I'm a bully?""","The phrase ""He's doing this to me"" and ""Why can't he take credit from someone else?"" shows a tendency to personalize the situation, assuming the actions are targeted specifically at the speaker. The question ""Think I'm a bully?"" reflects a possible label being applied to oneself without evidence, jumping to a negative identity. The core distortion is personalization because the speaker assumes the actions are intentionally directed at them, attributing causality and blame to themselves or the other person's behavior aimed specifically at them.",Personalization
2546,"I'm an introvert, but one person feels a little lonely.","""I'm an introvert"", ""one person feels a little lonely""","The statement identifies the speaker as an introvert and then points out that this person (presumably the speaker) feels lonely. The phrase 'one person feels a little lonely' indicates focusing on a negative personal feeling. However, the statement does not display all-or-nothing thinking or exaggeration. Instead, it labels the speaker by their introvert identity and connects it to a feeling of loneliness. The key point is identifying oneself as 'an introvert', which is a label applied to a person. This fits the distortion 'Labeling' where a person assigns a fixed, global label to themselves or others.",Labeling
2547,"Why did I just leave home for two or three years, they were so young, they left me, and suddenly, I was in the field, and they didn't see me last. My parents, I was so sad.","""they left me"", ""I was so sad""","The speaker expresses sadness linked to the perception that 'they left me,' implying a belief that others intentionally abandoned them. This reflects interpreting others' actions without concrete evidence of their intentions. The phrase 'they left me' indicates assuming the thoughts or feelings of others, which aligns with mind reading. The sadness is a reaction to this assumption. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing language, fortune-telling, labeling, or exaggeration. The core distortion lies in presuming knowledge of others' motivations or feelings.",Mind Reading
2548,It's not a good thing it's a disease. It's a bit of anxiety.,"""It's not a good thing it's a disease. It's a bit of anxiety.""","The speaker rejects the idea of anxiety being a 'disease,' instead downplaying it as 'a bit of anxiety,' which minimizes the seriousness or impact. This reflects a tendency to reduce or distort the true nature of the problem by focusing on a less severe interpretation, indicating minimization. However, from the provided list, magnification also captures distortion related to exaggerating or minimizing aspects. Here, the speaker minimizes the severity by rejecting the 'disease' label and reframing anxiety as mild. Thus, the distortion involves downplaying severity, consistent with magnification (in this case, minimizing rather than exaggerating). This is best classified as Magnification in a reversed sense.",Magnification
2549,"If I choose a path that doesn't suit me, all the hopes of my family will be lost. It's my fault.","If I choose a path that doesn't suit me, all the hopes of my family will be lost. It's my fault.","The statement assumes that a single decision (choosing a path) will lead to a catastrophic outcome (all the hopes of the family being lost) and that the speaker is entirely to blame. This indicates the person is taking responsibility for an outcome that is not fully within their control and attributing blame to themselves. The focus on self-blame reflects Personalization, as the individual internalizes external events or potential outcomes as their fault.",Personalization
2550,People in the community are always indifferent to me because I've never been active enough.,"""People in the community are always indifferent to me""; ""I've never been active enough""","The statement generalizes the behavior of the entire community ('always indifferent') based on past experiences. This implies a broad, sweeping conclusion without consideration for exceptions. The speaker assumes a global pattern of indifference due to their perceived lack of activity. This matches the definition of Overgeneralization, where a single event or limited evidence is used to make a universal judgment.",Overgeneralization
2551,"Cheung is so clumsy, he can't do anything.","""Cheung is so clumsy"", ""he can't do anything""","The statement assigns a broad negative label to Cheung ('so clumsy') and makes a sweeping generalization that he 'can't do anything,' implying a total incapability based on perceived clumsiness. This reflects the thinking pattern of drawing a broad, absolute conclusion from limited evidence, characteristic of overgeneralization. It is not labeling alone because the statement extends to an absolute inability, and not all-or-nothing thinking because it focuses on a generalized negative trait rather than black-and-white evaluation of an event or outcome.",Overgeneralization
2552,"You mean slow diet, slow digestion?","""slow diet, slow digestion""","The statement questions whether the 'diet' is slow by equating it with 'slow digestion.' It implicitly assumes a direct correlation or equivalence between diet speed and digestion speed without evidence. The speaker seems to predict or infer a negative outcome (slow digestion) based solely on the attribute 'slow diet,' resembling an assumption about future events without factual basis. This aligns with the distortion where one presumes to know future results without proof.",Fortune-telling
2553,There's someone in the company who likes to put pressure on me. There's gotta be someone else against me. There's always someone on my side.,"""There's someone in the company who likes to put pressure on me. There's gotta be someone else against me. There's always someone on my side.""","The statement shows a pattern of assuming the presence of different groups of people (those putting pressure, those against, those on the side) without concrete evidence. The phrase ""There's gotta be someone else against me"" indicates a prediction about others' thoughts or intentions without knowing for sure, which matches 'Mind Reading.' However, the belief that there ""always"" is someone on the side and someone against suggests an overreliance on assumptions about others' allegiances. The key distortion is the assumption about others’ intentions without proof. This is best categorized as 'Mind Reading,' where the person presumes knowledge of others' thoughts or feelings.",Mind Reading
2554,"Now I'm the only one awake, and I don't know what to do next, but weary and empty.","Now I'm the only one awake, and I don't know what to do next, but weary and empty.","The statement reflects a feeling of being alone and uncertain about the next steps, accompanied by feelings of weariness and emptiness. The key aspect is the emotional state 'weary and empty' derived from the situation 'I'm the only one awake and don't know what to do next.' This seems to be reasoning based mainly on the emotion experienced rather than objective facts. The person infers a negative internal state based primarily on how they feel at the moment, which aligns with emotional reasoning. There is no clear sign of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or other distortions. It is essentially drawing a conclusion about the situation influenced directly by their feelings.",Emotional Reasoning
2555,"I knew I'd forget to believe it, but I didn't write it, so I could fly a little less.","""I knew I'd forget to believe it"", ""I didn't write it"", ""so I could fly a little less""","The statement involves a prediction about future failure or forgetting ('I knew I'd forget to believe it'), which reflects assuming a negative outcome without evidence at present. This aligns closely with 'Fortune-telling,' a cognitive distortion where one predicts a negative event will happen despite no certainty. There is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing extremes, emotional self-justification, or labeling. The reasoning centers on anticipating failure and impact on ability ('fly a little less'). Hence, this is best classified as Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
2556,"If I were to be found sexual, I'd be rejected by everyone, engraved on the wall of shame.","""If I were to be found sexual, I'd be rejected by everyone, engraved on the wall of shame.""","The statement predicts a negative social consequence (rejection by everyone) without any concrete evidence. This shows the person is making a prediction about the future based on their assumed outcome. The phrase 'I'd be rejected by everyone' points to a belief about future social rejection. There is also a negative extreme consequence imagined ('engraved on the wall of shame'). This fits the pattern of Fortune-telling, where one assumes a negative outcome will definitely happen.",Fortune-telling
2557,Turns out the boss thinks I'm still not good.,the boss thinks I'm still not good,"The statement assumes the thoughts or opinions of the boss without direct evidence, implying the speaker is reading the boss's mind.

If there's a collision or there's a failure to deal with the consequences, what should we do?","""I can't stand the jamming of that car.""; ""If there's a collision or there's a failure to deal with the consequences, what should we do?""","The statement expresses intense discomfort with the situation ('I can't stand'), indicating emotional distress. The second part anticipates negative outcomes ('If there's a collision or failure to deal with consequences'), which suggests predicting future negative events without evidence. This is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling,' where a person assumes negative future events will occur.",Fortune-telling
2559,"If they're so naughty, I'll talk to my parents. Let their parents take care of it.","""If they're so naughty"", ""I'll talk to my parents"", ""Let their parents take care of it""","The phrase ""If they're so naughty"" implies a judgment or labeling of others based on their behavior. Then, ""I'll talk to my parents"" and ""Let their parents take care of it"" suggest transferring responsibility solely onto others, implying that those responsible must handle the problem. The key distortion is ""Labeling"" because the speaker categorizes others as ""naughty,"" an identity label rather than addressing specific behaviors objectively.",Labeling
2560,I'm so scared. I'm so sick. I'm not dying. I don't want to die.,"""I'm so scared. I'm so sick. I'm not dying. I don't want to die.""","The speaker expresses intense fear and physical distress ('I'm so scared. I'm so sick.') and then makes an uncertain statement about death ('I'm not dying. I don't want to die.'). This suggests the person is interpreting their emotional and physical state as indirect evidence of a catastrophic outcome (dying) despite lacking actual proof. This aligns with 'Emotional Reasoning,' where feelings of fear and sickness are taken as evidence of an impending negative outcome, even though the reality might differ.",Emotional Reasoning
2561,"Okay, it's still high protein.","""it's still high protein""","The phrase emphasizes the positive aspect ('still high protein') despite potential negatives that may have been implied earlier but are not stated here. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking (no absolute terms), emotional reasoning, predicting the future, labeling, magnifying negatives, filtering out positives, assuming others' thoughts, overgeneralizing, personalizing, or using 'should' statements. The statement appears neutral or positively reframing the situation, hence no cognitive distortion is evident.",No Distortion

""I don't want to see a teacher again.""","The statement includes an absolute negative judgment ('It's horrible') and a definitive conclusion about future behavior ('I'll never be on this street again for the weekend') as well as a generalized negative feeling towards seeing a teacher again. This indicates a broad negative conclusion drawn from a single or limited experience, suggesting a pattern where one event leads to an all-encompassing negative outcome. The phrase 'I'll never be...' exemplifies a rigid, absolute perspective, characteristic of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2564,"It's been a while since we graduated, and we can't make a decision about life, so we can't stay here for another year.","""we can't make a decision about life"", ""we can't stay here for another year""","The statement assumes that because a decision about life hasn't been made yet, staying in the current place for another year is unacceptable. This predicts a negative future outcome without sufficient evidence and implies the speaker knows what will happen or what they cannot do. This corresponds to 'Fortune-telling', as the person is predicting a negative future event based on current circumstances.",Fortune-telling

It's so hard to make friends. It's so fucked up.,"The statement expresses a broad, generalized negativity about social interactions and difficulty in making friends, stemming from the individual's experiences. The phrase 'a lot of trouble in people's relationships' and 'It's so hard to make friends' suggests the person is drawing a generalized conclusion that making friends is inherently difficult based on their current struggles. This is not necessarily an all-or-nothing perspective or fortune-telling about future events, but rather an overgeneralization from specific negative experiences to a wider context.",Overgeneralization

The speaker assumes what others are thinking or feeling towards them. This fits the definition of Mind Reading, where one assumes to know others' thoughts or motives. It is not Fortune-telling (predicting the future), nor Emotional Reasoning (basing truth on feelings), nor Personalization (taking responsibility for others' actions).",Mind Reading

It assumes awareness of others' thoughts and emotions (they'll look down on me). This reflects predicting a negative outcome and assuming what others will think about the speaker. Among the distortions, 'Fortune-telling' fits predicting the future negatively, and 'Mind Reading' fits assuming others' thoughts. However, the primary cognitive distortion here is predicting that these negative outcomes will occur, which aligns best with Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

The speaker assumes that the children's actions are directed specifically at them and takes their behavior personally. There is an element of assuming personal responsibility or blame for how others behave, which fits the distortion known as Personalization. The speaker is not necessarily mind reading or fortune-telling, as they do not claim to know the children’s exact thoughts or predict future events. They do not use absolute terms or filter selectively; the focus is on personal involvement in others' behavior.",Personalization

I want my father to see me change.,"""Learning is my responsibility."" and ""I want my father to see me change.""","The first phrase, ""Learning is my responsibility,"" reflects a clear sense of personal accountability and does not inherently involve any distortion. The second phrase, ""I want my father to see me change,"" expresses a desire related to another person's perception. It suggests an assumption or hope about how the father will perceive or acknowledge change but does not assume knowledge of his thoughts or feelings (which would indicate Mind Reading). Nor does it predict the future outcome definitively (which would indicate Fortune-telling). The statement does not exhibit rigid or extreme thinking (All-or-Nothing), nor does it involve labeling or excessive generalization. It mainly expresses a personal goal linked to how one hopes another person will respond. Therefore, there is no evident cognitive distortion in this statement.",No Distortion

This reflects predicting or assuming negative intentions and outcomes about others without facts. The key cognitive distortion here is 'Fortune-telling', as the speaker predicts harmful events and motives without proof.",Fortune-telling

The phrase ""she won't care about me anymore"" assumes the deceased person's thoughts or feelings without evidence, which is an example of mind reading. The statement also mixes an exaggerated self-evaluation ""I'm the best person in the family"" with feelings of unworthiness.

The second phrase assumes that the parents don't understand the speaker without explicit evidence, reflecting mind reading—believing one knows what others think or feel. However, since the task requires choosing only one distortion, personalization is more primary here because the sadness is linked to parents' sadness, showing the speaker is internalizing their emotions. Mind reading is secondary, but personalization better explains the root cognitive distortion.",Personalization

The labeling ('useless parent') is a classic distortion where a global negative label is applied. Additionally, the forecast that children will be hurt is an element of fortune-telling, but the more dominant distortion is the self-attaching negative label. Hence, the key distortion here is 'Labeling'.",Labeling

There is no evidence of dichotomous thinking (All-or-Nothing), predicting future events (Fortune-telling), or assigning labels. It does not involve emotional justification (Emotional Reasoning), nor selective focus on negative details (Mental filter), nor mind reading or personalization. The phrase 'it's not used for anything bad' suggests an evaluation of the money's use in moral terms but does not distort the logic or inflate negatives.

Additionally, the phrase ""I'm destined to suffer my whole life"" predicts a negative future outcome with certainty, which is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling'. However, the first phrase more strongly represents a rigid dichotomy (life either has meaning or it doesn't based on one factor), and the overall statement displays an extreme view of the situation rather than just a prediction, thus leaning more towards 'All-or-Nothing Thinking'.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This aligns with Emotional Reasoning. The phrases ""I'm a nobody"" and ""I'm worthless"" assign negative labels to oneself. Among the distortion types, Labeling is characterized by attaching a negative label to oneself or others. Since the statement contains both Emotional Reasoning and Labeling, we must identify the one most dominant or generalized throughout. The statement begins with an emotional evaluation and then immediately proceeds to global negative self-labeling. Given the three phrases taken together, the strongest, overriding distortion is Labeling because it encapsulates the sweeping negative judgment about self-identity (nobody, worthless). Emotional Reasoning appears in only one phrase whereas labeling is consistent and more encompassing. Therefore, Labeling is the most appropriate distortion type here.",Labeling
2587,I'm the bad star. Life is wasteful. Death is taking over the land. I'm worthless.,"""I'm the bad star"", ""Life is wasteful"", ""Death is taking over the land"", ""I'm worthless""","The statements include self-deprecating labels such as ""I'm the bad star"" and ""I'm worthless"" which clearly apply a negative label to the self. The sweeping negative view of life and death ('Life is wasteful', 'Death is taking over the land') amplifies a sense of hopelessness but the core cognitive distortion is the use of negative labeling on the self. This is distinct from overgeneralization or magnification because the specific focus is on defining oneself with a global negative label rather than predicting future outcomes or focusing on a single negative aspect.",Labeling
2588,They're a bunch of people who can't get along. It's my fault they're here.,"""They're a bunch of people who can't get along."" and ""It's my fault they're here.""","The first part of the statement generalizes the group as entirely unable to get along, which may suggest Overgeneralization or Labeling. However, the second part, ""It's my fault they're here,"" reflects self-blame where the speaker assumes personal responsibility for others' presence or situation without clear evidence. This indicates Personalization, as the individual attributes external events to themselves unjustifiably.",Personalization

This indicates a global, absolute statement that generalizes specific events to an overarching rule. The speaker assumes that whenever the other person wants someone to eat, they do not want anyone to talk to the speaker or are looking for the speaker, implying an exaggerated, broad conclusion based on particular instances.",Overgeneralization
2590,"This time the PPT forgot to save, and I'm wasting a lot of time, and I'm just trying to be careless.","""This time the PPT forgot to save"", ""I'm wasting a lot of time"", ""I'm just trying to be careless""","The statement focuses on a single incident where the PPT file was not saved, and the speaker interprets this as wasting a lot of time. Additionally, the speaker attributes the cause of this to their own carelessness, suggesting a self-blame. This reflects taking the event personally, assuming responsibility for the negative outcome. The key cognitive distortion is personalization, where one relates external events directly to themselves in a negative way, even if the cause might involve other factors.",Personalization
2591,This thing is killing me. What am I supposed to do to get out of this?,"""This thing is killing me.""","The phrase ""This thing is killing me"" is an exaggerated statement that amplifies the severity of the situation beyond what is likely true. This represents a distortion where the person magnifies the negative aspects of the situation, making it seem far worse than it actually is. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or fortune-telling here. The expression does not show emotional reasoning tied directly to feelings justifying reality, rather it is an amplification of the problem's impact.",Magnification
2592,"It's just a cookie. It doesn't have much heat, but it doesn't eat much.","""It's just a cookie."" ""It doesn't have much heat"" ""but it doesn't eat much.""","The statement ""It's just a cookie"" minimizes the importance or significance of the cookie, suggesting that it's not a big deal. The phrase ""It doesn't have much heat"" could imply low impact or effect, and ""but it doesn't eat much"" might indicate a limitation in its function. There is no evidence of catastrophic thinking (All-or-Nothing), emotional assumptions (Emotional Reasoning), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), assigning negative labels (Labeling), exaggerating importance (Magnification), focusing only on negatives (Mental filter), assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading), broad conclusions based on a single fact (Overgeneralization), self-blame (Personalization), or imposing rules (Should statements). Instead, the statement neutrally describes the item without distortion.",No Distortion
2593,"All I have to do is listen to the doctor, take medication on time, stay positive and positive.","All I have to do is listen to the doctor, take medication on time, stay positive and positive.","The statement implies a simplification of a situation into a set of absolute requirements that will ostensibly guarantee a positive outcome. The phrase 'All I have to do' connotes an absolute, either/or framing of the situation, suggesting that if these exact actions are followed, the problem will be resolved without fail. This reflects an exacting, black-and-white view rather than a nuanced or probabilistic outlook, which is characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

I'm young, I have great potential, I'll be in his place sooner or later!","""he's just jealous of me"", ""I'm young"", ""I have great potential"", ""I'll be in his place sooner or later""","The speaker assumes the reason for the other person's behavior is jealousy without direct evidence, which indicates a belief about someone else's thoughts or feelings. This is a form of 'Mind Reading'—believing you know what others are thinking or feeling without confirmation. Additionally, the statement ""I'll be in his place sooner or later"" reflects a confident prediction about the future based purely on current subjective interpretation, which could suggest some Fortune-telling, but the primary distortion is reading the other person's mind.",Mind Reading
2595,I can't even guarantee my health. Should I still be in this world? I don't seem to see color between darkness and day.,I can't even guarantee my health. Should I still be in this world? I don't seem to see color between darkness and day.,"The statement reflects a negative and absolute view of the situation (not being able to guarantee health) that leads to questioning one's entire existence ('Should I still be in this world?'). The phrase 'I don't seem to see color between darkness and day' suggests a perception that things are either extremely bad or not good at all, indicating a lack of middle ground or nuance. This suggests a black-and-white perspective typical of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where situations are viewed in extremes without acknowledging gradations or complexities.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2596,"She's so bad, she's not scientific, she's got a dark spot.","""She's so bad"", ""she's not scientific"", ""she's got a dark spot""","The statement applies negative labels directly to the person: calling her ""so bad"" and implying a character flaw with ""she's got a dark spot."" These labels are broad, global judgments rather than specific, situational critiques. While there is a negative evaluation involved, it is not about all or nothing, fortune-telling, or emotional reasoning specifically. The core distortion is attaching generalized negative labels to the person.",Labeling
2597,"The company's bankruptcy and the scarcity of money, my old friends will look down on me, and I will be despised by everyone.","The company's bankruptcy and the scarcity of money, my old friends will look down on me, and I will be despised by everyone.","The statement predicts future negative social judgments ('my old friends will look down on me' and 'I will be despised by everyone') without evidence, assuming that these things will definitely happen. This is a classic example of assuming knowledge of future events and outcomes negatively, which fits the cognitive distortion known as Fortune-telling. The person is forecasting an unfavorable future outcome related to others' opinions and reactions.",Fortune-telling
2598,I feel like that's what our kids are gonna do. It's sad.,"""I feel like that's what our kids are gonna do.""","The speaker is making a prediction about the future behavior of their kids without evidence, expressing this as a certainty. This is a classic example of predicting negative outcomes without factual basis.",Fortune-telling
2599,"Every time I'm ready to leave, something like this happens. It never ends. Locks me in.","""Every time I'm ready to leave"", ""something like this happens"", ""It never ends"", ""Locks me in""","The statement implies that the speaker believes a negative event always occurs whenever they try to leave, suggesting a persistent, repeated problem without exception. Phrases like ""Every time"" and ""It never ends"" indicate the universal and continuous nature of the problem, which fits the pattern of overgeneralizing from specific instances to a never-ending trend. The feeling of being ""locked in"" reinforces the belief in an unchanging, unavoidable cycle.",Overgeneralization
2600,"Working hard means that parents are motivated and willing to fight for their ideals. As children, they should support them.","""Working hard means that parents are motivated and willing to fight for their ideals.""; ""As children, they should support them.""","The statement includes a prescriptive phrase 'should support them,' indicating an expectation or rule about how children must behave toward their parents. This reflects an internal demand or obligation rather than an objective fact, which aligns with the 'Should statements' distortion. The rest of the sentence explains or justifies this expectation but does not itself represent a distortion.",Should statements
2601,"There's fun and noise out there, and I'm always excluded from all the happiness and happiness in the world.",I'm always excluded from all the happiness and happiness in the world.,"The phrase 'I'm always excluded from all the happiness' suggests a broad and sweeping conclusion based on limited evidence. The use of the word 'always' implies that this exclusion happens every time without exception, and 'all the happiness in the world' exaggerates the scope of the exclusion. This indicates a pattern of taking a single or limited experience and generalizing it to an overall negative truth, which aligns with the definition of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2602,"When I think about it, it makes me feel like I'm failing.","""When I think about it, it makes me feel like I'm failing.""","The phrase indicates that the person's feeling of failure is derived from their interpretation or emotional response rather than from objective evidence. The statement relies on an emotional reaction ('it makes me feel like') to conclude they are failing, which matches the pattern of Emotional Reasoning — assuming something is true based on how one feels.",Emotional Reasoning
2603,"Lately, the head is often dizzy and feels like he's in a terrible state of health, and the leader is bound to fire a poor person like me.","the head is often dizzy and feels like he's in a terrible state of health, the leader is bound to fire a poor person like me","The speaker notes physical symptoms (dizziness, feeling very unwell) and immediately concludes that the leader will definitely fire them due to their perceived poor condition. This reflects predicting a negative future outcome without evidence. The key cognitive distortion here is Fortune-telling, where the person assumes they know what will happen in the future (being fired) based on their current feelings and situation (health and self-assessment). There is no clear all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, or emotional reasoning beyond the future prediction, so Fortune-telling is the best fit.",Fortune-telling
2604,I'm a useless piece of shit. I don't want to be happy with my parents.,"""I'm a useless piece of shit""; ""I don't want to be happy with my parents""","The phrase ""I'm a useless piece of shit"" is a strong, negative self-label that generalizes the speaker's entire self-worth based on presumed failures or flaws. This reflects the cognitive distortion known as Labeling, where one assigns a negative label to oneself rather than looking at specific behaviors or situations. The second phrase shows avoidance of happiness potentially linked to this negative self-view, but it doesn't indicate distortions like fortune-telling or mind reading. The main distortion here is Labeling due to the harsh global self-judgment.",Labeling
2605,"I wish I could talk like others, confident and open my mouth.","I wish I could talk like others, confident and open my mouth.","The statement expresses a desire to be like others who are confident and able to speak openly, implying a comparison. However, it does not imply seeing things in black-or-white terms (All-or-Nothing), nor does it suggest predictions about the future (Fortune-telling), or judging self-worth (Labeling). It also does not involve filtering out positive information (Mental filter) or assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading). The sentence primarily reflects a belief in how one 'should' be able to talk—confident and open—indicating a 'Should statement' distortion. Such 'Should statements' impose rigid rules or expectations on oneself, often leading to frustration or disappointment when those expectations are unmet.",Should statements
2606,It's because I'm too self-conscious to see myself too much to make that happen.,,,ERROR
2607,The difference between us is too big for me to tell him. I'm such a loser.,"""The difference between us is too big for me to tell him."" and ""I'm such a loser.""","The first part of the statement highlights a perceived significant difference that prevents communication, indicating a negative self-judgment. The phrase ""I'm such a loser"" is a direct assignment of a negative label to oneself based on the situation. This is a classic example of 'Labeling', where the individual generalizes a single negative event or characteristic into a global, negative identity. While there is some emotional reasoning about the difficulty in communication, the core cognitive distortion lies in the negative global label 'loser' rather than just interpreting feelings or thoughts.",Labeling
2608,"My classmates are fast, I'm slow, they're harder than I am, and I'll never catch up with them.","My classmates are fast, I'm slow, they're harder than I am, and I'll never catch up with them.","The statement compares the speaker's speed and ability directly to their classmates, emphasizing a binary distinction: classmates are fast and hard, while the speaker is slow and inferior. The assertion that they will 'never catch up' suggests a fixed, absolute outcome without room for change. This reflects an 'all-or-nothing' mindset where things are viewed in black-and-white terms without acknowledging any middle ground or possibilities for improvement.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2609,Eating a cookie doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.,Eating a cookie doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.,"The statement minimizes the significance of eating a cookie by outright dismissing it as unimportant, repeating that it 'doesn't matter.' This reflects a tendency to reduce the complexity or possible consequences of an action to an absolute, binary judgment. However, it does not involve making predictions about the future (Fortune-telling), interpreting or assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading), or exaggerating importance (Magnification). The speaker is not making a broad generalization beyond the immediate action nor blaming self or others (Personalization, Labeling). This indicates a black-and-white thinking pattern, indicative of seeing the action in absolute terms of significance versus insignificance, aligning most closely with All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2610,"You didn't pay them back, did you? How could anyone do that these days?","""You didn't pay them back, did you? How could anyone do that these days?""","The first part, 'You didn't pay them back, did you?' is a direct inquiry but the second part, 'How could anyone do that these days?' implies a generalized negative judgment about the behavior of paying someone back. It suggests that the speaker assumes no one would fail to pay back, thus painting the act of not paying back as universally unacceptable. This reflects an overgeneralization because the speaker takes a specific instance or concern and extends it to everyone ('anyone') indiscriminately, assuming a broad, negative rule or norm.",Overgeneralization
2611,"I haven't planned for myself since I was a kid, and even if I'm not exactly right, it's because I'm too careful, and I'm ashamed of Mom.","""I haven't planned for myself since I was a kid"", ""it's because I'm too careful"", ""I'm ashamed of Mom""","The statement shows a broad generalization of the speaker's behavior over a long period ('since I was a kid'), indicating a pattern rather than a specific event. This fits with overgeneralization, where one negative experience or self-assessment is extended to an overall negative judgment. Additionally, the speaker attributes their current state to an internal cause ('too careful') and connects it emotionally to feeling shame related to their mom, but there is no clear evidence of mind reading (assuming others' thoughts) or emotional reasoning alone. The most prominent distortion is the sweeping negative conclusion about themselves, which is typical of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2612,I can't take care of the kids. The kids must be complaining about me.,"""I can't take care of the kids."" and ""The kids must be complaining about me.""","The first phrase expresses a negative self-evaluation, potentially showing personalization or all-or-nothing thinking, but it alone is not conclusive. The second phrase assumes knowledge of others' thoughts and feelings without evidence, specifically 'The kids must be complaining about me.' This indicates the speaker is presuming to read the minds of the kids. Mind Reading cognitive distortion is characterized by assuming what others are thinking without concrete evidence. Since the key distortion here is the assumption about others' thoughts, 'Mind Reading' fits best.",Mind Reading
2613,My roommate and I had a hard time. It made me feel bad.,"""It made me feel bad.""","The statement indicates that because the situation with the roommate was hard, the speaker feels bad. This reflects Emotional Reasoning as the speaker's feelings of badness are taken as evidence that the situation is negative or problematic, rather than evaluating facts objectively.",Emotional Reasoning
2614,I'm sorry. Next time I'll make sure I spend more time with the kids. I'm really busy.,"""Next time I'll make sure I spend more time with the kids"" and ""I'm really busy""","The statement contains a commitment about what should happen next time: the speaker says they will 'make sure' to spend more time with the kids, implying an expectation or obligation to change behavior. Additionally, mentioning 'I'm really busy' serves as a justification for current behavior, but the key component is the implied rule or expectation regarding how time with kids should be managed. This matches the 'Should statements' distortion, where the individual imposes rigid rules or expectations on themselves or others.",Should statements
2615,Why is this happening in my house? It must be God's punishment.,"""It must be God's punishment.""","The statement interprets a negative event as a direct punishment from a higher power, assuming a causative relationship without evidence. This reflects Emotional Reasoning because the individual is using their emotional reaction (distress about the event) as proof that the event is a punishment, rather than considering other explanations or facts.",Emotional Reasoning
2616,A lot of work is the best way to get rid of the enthusiasm.,A lot of work is the best way to get rid of the enthusiasm,"The statement implies that 'a lot of work' will always lead to 'getting rid of enthusiasm', which suggests a broad, absolute conclusion drawn from presumably limited experience or evidence. This is characteristic of overgeneralization, where a single outcome is viewed as universal or inevitable. There is no indication of extreme black-and-white thinking (all-or-nothing), emotional inference, or predictive certainty beyond this broad generalization, so overgeneralization fits best.",Overgeneralization
2617,I can't eat these things while I'm losing weight. I'm a terrible self-controlist!,"""I can't eat these things while I'm losing weight."" and ""I'm a terrible self-controlist!""","The first part of the statement expresses a black-and-white rule, implying that eating certain foods is completely forbidden during weight loss, reflecting an all-or-nothing mindset. The second part includes the self-label 'terrible self-controlist,' which is a negative global judgment about oneself based on this behavior. While labeling is present, the initial rigid thought pattern about eating habits aligns more closely with all-or-nothing thinking. The person is interpreting their behavior in an absolute way without considering any middle ground.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2618,Wasn't it the first time I came in without the courtesy of saying hello?,Wasn't it the first time I came in without the courtesy of saying hello?,"The statement implies the speaker is assuming they know what others expect (the courtesy of saying hello) and possibly what others think about their action. The phrase 'without the courtesy of saying hello' reflects an interpretation of others' feelings or judgments without direct evidence, which aligns with mind reading. It does not indicate the speaker is making an absolute or exaggerated judgment (no all-or-nothing or magnification), nor are they generalizing beyond this situation. It also does not involve predicting the future (fortune-telling) or using 'should' statements explicitly. The core distortion here is assuming knowledge of others' expectations or thoughts without confirmation.",Mind Reading
2619,I'm sure they're very close to me. I'll never be able to fit in with them. I'll always be the one who's isolated.,"""I'm sure they're very close to me."" ""I'll never be able to fit in with them."" ""I'll always be the one who's isolated.""","The statement involves the speaker making a definite prediction about future social outcomes ('I'll never be able to fit in', 'I'll always be isolated') without evidence, which is characteristic of Fortune-telling. The speaker assumes negative outcomes will inevitably happen. While there is some emotional undertone, the main distortion is predicting a negative future based on current feelings or assumptions. This is distinct from Mind Reading because the focus is on the future prediction rather than current thoughts of others. It also does not fit All-or-Nothing Thinking or Overgeneralization perfectly as it is focused mainly on future certainty.",Fortune-telling
2620,I'm such a piece of shit.,"""I'm such a piece of shit.""","The statement involves the speaker assigning a harsh and negative label to themselves. It is a global, absolute, and negative evaluation of the self, which fits the definition of 'Labeling'—a cognitive distortion where a person gives themselves or others a fixed, negative, and broad descriptor based on a mistake or perceived flaw.",Labeling
2621,My parents were born and raised me for nothing.,"""My parents were born and raised me for nothing.""","The statement implies that the parents' efforts and existence in raising the speaker have resulted in no value or benefit, which is an absolute and generalized judgment. This shows an extreme, black-and-white view of the situation, where the speaker sees their parents' actions as entirely worthless rather than considering any nuanced or mixed outcomes. This absolutist viewpoint aligns closely with All-or-Nothing Thinking, as the speaker is making a sweeping negative evaluation without middle ground or exceptions.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2622,I have a completely annoying personality. How can I be the leader? I can't.,"""I have a completely annoying personality.""; ""How can I be the leader? I can't.""","The speaker assigns a global negative label to themselves by saying they have a 'completely annoying personality,' which exemplifies the 'Labeling' distortion. Further, they conclude that they cannot be a leader based on that label, showing an all-encompassing negative self-assessment rather than a balanced view. No evidence of predictions about the future (fortune-telling), solely emotional reasoning, or other distortions is prominent here, making 'Labeling' the most appropriate categorization.",Labeling
2623,I'm a terrible teacher. I'm sorry I didn't make it clear. I wasn't patient enough to give him 70 points.,"""I'm a terrible teacher"", ""I wasn't patient enough""","The speaker labels themselves globally and negatively as ""a terrible teacher"" based on a specific action or event (not being patient enough or not making something clear). This is a classic example of Labeling, where a person assigns a negative label to themselves rather than considering the situation or behavior objectively. The statement does not reflect an all-or-nothing evaluation of all qualities but a broad negative identity label based on limited evidence.",Labeling
2624,"It's so sad that I'm not their only child, and I think they value me, and they'll stop the cold violence when they say it today.","I'm not their only child, I think they value me, they'll stop the cold violence when they say it today","The statement includes the phrase 'I think they value me,' which indicates an assumption about others' thoughts or feelings without concrete evidence. This suggests the individual is attempting to infer the intentions or emotions of others, fitting the description of Mind Reading. The expectation that 'they'll stop the cold violence when they say it today' is a prediction about future behavior based on current emotions but does not primarily reflect Fortune-telling because it is tied to assumed thoughts rather than prediction of events without evidence. Therefore, the dominant distortion here is Mind Reading.",Mind Reading
2625,"I don't care what I'm doing, I'm doing this to my family and friends, and I'm just messing with people.","""I'm doing this to my family and friends"", ""I'm just messing with people""","The statement reflects taking personal responsibility (or blame) for the impact on family and friends, implying that the speaker believes their actions are directly affecting them negatively. This shows a tendency to personalize the situation by attributing external events or others' feelings directly to oneself, without considering other factors. There is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions in the statement. The key cognitive distortion is 'Personalization', as the individual is focusing on themselves as the cause of others' experiences.",Personalization
2626,"Now that I've just been promoted, there must be a lot of people staring at me, hoping to pull me off the horse.","""there must be a lot of people staring at me, hoping to pull me off the horse""","The speaker assumes that many people are watching them with negative intentions without concrete evidence. This involves making assumptions about others' thoughts or feelings, which characterizes mind reading.

2627,"The excessive interference of parents makes me feel like a prison, and my freedom has been mercilessly deprived.","""excessive interference of parents"", ""feel like a prison"", ""freedom has been mercilessly deprived""","The statement uses highly dramatic and extreme language to describe the parents' interference, comparing the situation to being in a prison and claiming freedom is 'mercilessly deprived.' This reflects an exaggeration of the negative aspects of the experience, amplifying the adversity beyond what may be realistic. There is no evidence of absolute thinking (all-or-nothing), predicting the future (fortune-telling), or assuming others' thoughts (mind reading). The focus is on exaggerating the negative impact, which aligns with magnification.",Magnification

I'm wasting social resources.,"""I don't have a job in the world for me.""; ""I'm wasting social resources.""","The phrase ""I don't have a job in the world for me"" overgeneralizes the situation, implying that no employment opportunities exist universally, not just in a specific context. Similarly, ""I'm wasting social resources"" involves an exaggerated negative appraisal of one's impact or worth. Both statements reflect drawing broad, sweeping conclusions based on limited evidence or current circumstances.",Overgeneralization

It makes me feel like I'm nothing.","""I'm sure my parents are going to compare me to his children""; ""It makes me feel like I'm nothing.""","The statement expresses a prediction about what the parents will do (compare the speaker to someone else's children) without evidence, which indicates assuming knowledge of others' future actions. This fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling' since the speaker is predicting a negative outcome. Additionally, the feeling of worthlessness stems from this predicted event. Although there is an element of 'Mind Reading' in assuming parents' thoughts, the key cognitive distortion here is the act of predicting a future event negatively, which is hallmark of Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

""I knew she wasn't such a good-looking girl.""","The statement assumes the girl's behavior without factual evidence, specifically assuming her friend seduced her. This reflects making assumptions about others' intentions or thoughts. Additionally, judging her worth based on looks and connecting that to her behavior indicates assigning a negative characteristic or label. The first part fits the definition of Mind Reading because the speaker presumes to know the friend's motives without proof. The second part involves Labeling, as the speaker assigns a negative label related to attractiveness. However, since the main cognitive distortion revolves around presumptive reasoning about the friend's actions and intentions, Mind Reading is the primary distortion.",Mind Reading
2631,I can only watch them eat. I'm envious. Why am I in bad shape?,I can only watch them eat. I'm envious. Why am I in bad shape?,"The phrase 'I can only watch them eat' implies a sense of helplessness or limitation. The statement 'I'm envious' expresses an emotional reaction. The question 'Why am I in bad shape?' shows a negative self-assessment. This sequence indicates the person is interpreting their feelings and self-condition based mainly on how they feel (envy) rather than objective facts. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where the individual concludes reality based on their feelings rather than actual evidence.",Emotional Reasoning
2632,I did not consciously isolate myself from all the people I spoke to because I looked disgusting.,I did not consciously isolate myself from all the people I spoke to because I looked disgusting.,"The speaker assumes that their reason for isolating themselves is because they looked disgusting, which reflects an emotional judgment influencing their interpretation of their behavior. This is reasoning based on feeling (looking disgusting) rather than objective evidence about their interaction. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as facts.",Emotional Reasoning
2633,"He turned me down this time, and I know that I'll always be alone.","""He turned me down this time"", ""I know that I'll always be alone""","The statement starts with a specific event—being turned down once—and then jumps to a broad, sweeping conclusion about the entire future dating life, stating that the speaker will always be alone. This reflects the cognitive distortion of applying one experience disproportionately to all future circumstances. It is not about black-and-white thinking or emotional state influencing facts, but rather about making a general rule based on a single instance. This matches the definition of Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2634,I'm a lazy guy compared to my roommate who's been studying so well.,"""I'm a lazy guy""; ""compared to my roommate who's been studying so well""","The speaker labels themselves negatively by calling themselves ""lazy"" based on a comparison with their roommate. This is a clear case of attaching a global negative label to oneself rather than evaluating specific behaviors or circumstances. The judgment ""lazy"" is a fixed label, not a specific critique of an isolated action, implying a cognitive distortion of labeling.",Labeling
2635,"Once you lose, you can no longer lift your head in front of your colleagues, which will be a stain on me forever.","Once you lose, you can no longer lift your head in front of your colleagues, which will be a stain on me forever.","The statement assumes that losing a single event will permanently damage the speaker's reputation and self-esteem, suggesting no possibility for recovery or nuance.

Such all-or-nothing thinking ignores the likelihood of learning from mistakes or regaining respect over time.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2636,This is the PPT show of our team's work. It's my fault. I didn't save it.,"""It's my fault. I didn't save it.""","The speaker is attributing the failure of the PPT show entirely to themselves, indicating a sense of personal responsibility for the negative outcome. This reflects the distortion of taking excessive blame for events that may involve other factors or people. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or labeling present. The focus on personal blame fits the definition of Personalization.",Personalization
2637,I have to find a reasonable way to reduce my overtime and ease my stress.,find a reasonable way to reduce my overtime and ease my stress,"The statement expresses a desire to find a reasonable way to improve the situation, showing problem-solving intent rather than a cognitive distortion. There are no indications of black-and-white thinking, emotional reasoning, or other distortions such as labeling or fortune-telling. The phrase 'have to' is used here to emphasize necessity but not in a rigid or extreme way that constitutes a 'Should statement' distortion. Overall, the statement is balanced and realistic.",No Distortion

The speaker proposes a practical solution by taking a break and planning to resume work later. There is no evidence of black-and-white thinking, assuming negative outcomes, labeling selves or others, or emotional reasoning. The speaker is realistically assessing their capacity and adjusting their actions accordingly.",No Distortion
2639,"And heaven is only for the wise and gifted, and I am not worthy of a good achievement.","""heaven is only for the wise and gifted"", ""I am not worthy of a good achievement""","The statement implies a rigid boundary that only certain people (the wise and gifted) deserve heaven, excluding the speaker who views themselves as unworthy. This reflects a black-and-white perspective without acknowledging any middle ground or exceptions. The phrase 'only for the wise and gifted' exemplifies an absolute categorization of worthiness, indicative of All-or-Nothing Thinking. The speaker's negative self-assessment stems from this absolute categorization.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2640,It's so painful. It's got a nose all the time. I really hate the cold.,"""It's so painful."", ""It's got a nose all the time."", ""I really hate the cold.""","The statement focuses on the intense feeling of pain ('It's so painful'), implying the pain is constant and overwhelming. This emphasizes the emotional experience as evidence of the situation's negativity. Additionally, expressing hate towards the cold amplifies the negative perception of the situation. Given the emphasis on feelings ('so painful') as proof of reality (something is truly painful), this aligns closely with Emotional Reasoning, where emotions are taken as objective evidence of truth.",Emotional Reasoning
2641,"I feel like men don't have a good thing, like every man I meet, and it fills me with despair.","""men don't have a good thing"", ""every man I meet"", ""it fills me with despair""","The statement generalizes a negative experience or perception about men to all men the speaker meets, which indicates a broad conclusion based on limited encounters. The phrase ""every man I meet"" shows an overgeneralization from specific examples to a universal statement about all men. This is not about an either/or situation (not all-or-nothing), nor primarily about predicting the future, reading minds, or labeling. The emotional aspect of despair is present, but the core distortion is the generalized negative conclusion.",Overgeneralization
2642,I don't want to tell them my secret anymore. Tell them everything. Tell her she'll tell them again next time.,"""Tell her she'll tell them again next time""","The statement involves predicting a future event — that the person will reveal the secret again — without concrete evidence. This is an example of assuming knowledge about what will happen in the future, which fits the definition of Fortune-telling. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, labeling, or other distortions here. The speaker is expecting a negative outcome predictively.",Fortune-telling

We'll hang out next time.""","The phrase ""Maybe there's an emergency we can't come"" involves predicting a specific negative outcome without concrete evidence, which aligns with guessing the future negatively. This reflects 'Fortune-telling' as the speaker is speculating on a possibility that may cause a cancellation. The rest of the statement offers acceptance and a positive outlook, indicating no other distortions like magnification or all-or-nothing thinking. Therefore, the key distortion is predicting a negative future event.",Fortune-telling
2644,I don't deserve a friend of mine. I don't deserve a friend of mine.,"""I don't deserve a friend of mine.""","The statement reflects a negative judgment about oneself that applies broadly without clear evidence. The speaker claims they do not deserve a friend, which suggests a global conclusion about their worthiness related to friendships. This is not about predicting the future (Fortune-telling), nor about interpreting others' thoughts (Mind Reading), nor setting unrealistic standards (Should statements). It is not all-or-nothing because the statement is more about worthiness rather than absolutes of success/failure. The thought appears to generalize from a particular feeling or situation to an overall conclusion about deserving friendship, which is characteristic of Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2645,I can't afford anything in my economy. It's a terrible place to live like a dog's nest.,"""I can't afford anything in my economy.""; ""It's a terrible place to live like a dog's nest.""","The speaker states an absolute statement about not being able to afford anything, which is an overgeneralization since it implies a total lack of affordability without nuances. Additionally, the phrase calling the place 'a terrible place to live like a dog's nest' labels the environment negatively in an exaggerated way. However, the dominant distortion is the broad statement about inability to afford anything, extending a single difficulty to all things financially, which fits overgeneralization best.",Overgeneralization
2646,"Sometimes I really want to cut off the uterus, so there's no such thing as the present and the future.","Sometimes I really want to cut off the uterus, so there's no such thing as the present and the future.","The statement expresses a desire to eliminate the uterus as a way to eliminate the concepts of present and future. This suggests a distorted way of thinking that associates a physical action with changing time or reality, likely driven by emotional distress. The phrase 'so there's no such thing as the present and the future' indicates a form of emotional reasoning, where feelings or distress are leading to a belief that a drastic physical change would alter abstract concepts like time. There is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, magnification, mental filter, mind reading, overgeneralization, personalization, or should statements. The distortion closest fitting the reasoning is Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

The phrase 'I don't know anything but what I'm told' implies a complete lack of independent knowledge, which is an extreme generalization. Similarly, saying 'I'm wasted in this position' and 'I've never been a leader' reinforces a global negative evaluation of self-capacity and role, without considering any exceptions or nuances. This shows a tendency to overgeneralize negative conclusions based on potentially limited evidence.",Overgeneralization
2648,"I spent so much money, I can't find out what's wrong with me, incompetent doctor!","I spent so much money, I can't find out what's wrong with me, incompetent doctor!","The statement contains blaming the doctor by calling them 'incompetent' based on the failure to find a diagnosis. This assigns a negative label to the doctor rather than focusing on specific actions or evidence. The speaker expresses frustration and attributes the problem to the doctor's ability. This matches the cognitive distortion of Labeling, where an individual assigns a global negative trait to someone.",Labeling
2649,I'm a failed teacher. I'm not popular with them.,"""I'm a failed teacher"", ""I'm not popular with them""","The phrase ""I'm a failed teacher"" applies a global negative label to the self based on perceived failure, which is characteristic of Labeling. The statement ""I'm not popular with them"" could be taken as a factual observation, but when combined with the self-label of failure, it suggests an overall negative self-judgment rather than specific evidence of failure. No evidence of all-or-nothing (complete success or failure), fortune-telling, or emotional reasoning is explicitly stated. Therefore, the primary distortion is Labeling.",Labeling

This reflects an overgeneralization because it applies characteristics of a few individuals to an entire larger group without sufficient evidence. The language used is also quite absolute and unfairly categorizes the group with a negative trait.",Overgeneralization

The phrase 'I'm scared every day' underlines the emotional basis for the conclusion. This pattern exemplifies Emotional Reasoning, where a person's feelings are interpreted as facts without considering other perspectives or evidence.",Emotional Reasoning

This is characteristic of 'Should statements,' where the speaker places rigid demands or expectations on themselves or others. The other parts acknowledge a generalization about women liking beauty and a personal respect but do not indicate other distortions. Thus, the main distortion is in the use of 'important to' implying a 'should' or 'must' belief.",Should statements
2654,"It is easy for me to say the wrong thing, and everyone does not want to be my friend, as it is.","""It is easy for me to say the wrong thing"", ""everyone does not want to be my friend""","The statement implies a global conclusion about social rejection based on presumably some incidents or feelings. The phrase ""everyone does not want to be my friend"" reflects a sweeping generalization from possibly limited negative experiences, assuming that no one wants to be friends with the speaker. This broad generalization from specific events or feelings indicates an overgeneralization distortion.",Overgeneralization

This reflects labeling, where the individual is given a fixed negative identity rather than addressing specific behaviors or circumstances. The focus is not on an isolated event (which would be overgeneralization), nor is it based on predictions (fortune-telling) or emotions as evidence (emotional reasoning). The language clearly demonstrates assigning a negative label to the person.",Labeling

They may have seen my naked picture, so point to me.","""I'm always being looked at on the road."", ""They must be laughing at me."", ""They may have seen my naked picture, so point to me.""","The statement involves assumptions about others' thoughts and actions without clear evidence. The speaker believes others are looking at them and laughing, and further assumes they have seen a naked picture, which makes others point at them. This suggests the speaker is attributing specific negative thoughts and behaviors to others without proof. This aligns best with Mind Reading, where the individual believes they know what others are thinking or feeling.",Mind Reading
2657,The painful contrast makes me feel the damage to self-esteem.,The painful contrast makes me feel the damage to self-esteem.,"The statement infers a feeling of damage to self-esteem based primarily on the emotional experience of a 'painful contrast.' This involves concluding something is true about the self (damage to self-esteem) based on how one feels (painful contrast causing bad feelings). Such reasoning reflects Emotional Reasoning, where emotions are taken as evidence for the truth of a negative self-assessment, rather than objective facts.",Emotional Reasoning

I'm going to get killed.""","The key phrase indicates the speaker is predicting a negative and extreme outcome (getting killed) based on the current situation of having a tough day and getting paid. This is a prediction about the future without concrete evidence. The worry is focused on an anticipated event that hasn't occurred yet. This aligns closely with the cognitive distortion type where one assumes they can foresee negative outcomes in the future, known as 'Fortune-telling.'",Fortune-telling
2659,I don't think I'll be able to talk until I die.,"""I don't think I'll be able to talk until I die.""","The statement makes a definitive prediction about the future without evidence, assuming a negative outcome will certainly happen.

The individual wonders if the pain is a form of punishment specifically for their actions, which reflects an internalized blame and a belief that external events are caused by oneself. This closely aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Personalization, where one assumes excessive responsibility for events beyond their control.",Personalization
2661,"Every time a roommate comes to help me with my classes, I'm a waste of air.","""Every time a roommate comes to help me with my classes, I'm a waste of air.""","The phrase ""Every time"" indicates a pattern generalized to all instances, suggesting that whenever help is offered, the person labels themselves negatively. The phrase ""I'm a waste of air"" is a global, negative statement about the self, reflecting an extreme negative labeling. The key aspect is assigning a negative label to oneself based on specific events rather than balanced or objective evaluation. This reflects the cognitive distortion known as Labeling, where one attributes a fixed, negative trait to themselves.",Labeling
2662,"If I fail to be good to my parents, I will surely be punished and my future children will be bad to me.","If I fail to be good to my parents, I will surely be punished and my future children will be bad to me.",The statement predicts a negative future outcome (being punished and future children being bad) based on a current action (failing to be good to parents) without evidence. This reflects an assumption about what will happen in the future. The certainty implied by 'surely' indicates the person is making a specific prediction about future events.,Fortune-telling

It shows a balanced view rather than an extreme or polarized perspective. The speaker also encourages calm discussion and reconciliation, indicating a reasonable and hopeful outlook. There is no evidence of emotional reasoning (i.e., basing truth solely on feelings), no labeling, no catastrophizing or magnifying of problems, no assuming what others think (mind reading), no predicting negative outcomes (fortune-telling), and no all-or-nothing thinking.

""No one would accept a strange person like me.""","The statement 'My existence was a mistake' and 'It was all wrong' reflect a harsh, absolute judgment about oneself. This aligns with labeling, which involves assigning a fixed, negative identity to oneself. Additionally, the belief that 'No one would accept a strange person like me' shows an assumption about others' perceptions without evidence. However, since the dominant theme is the self-condemnation and the assigning of a negative global label ('a mistake'), labeling fits best. While there is some mind reading ('No one would accept...'), the primary distortion centers on the global negative identity.",Labeling
2665,What are we gonna do? This kid's a stone head. He can't reflect on himself.,"""This kid's a stone head"", ""He can't reflect on himself""","The speaker uses a harsh, fixed label ""stone head"" to describe the kid, implying a negative and unchangeable characteristic. This is a classic example of labeling, where a person is characterized in an absolute and negative way, rather than describing a specific behavior or situation. There is no evidence of the speaker predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or thinking in extremes across situations (All-or-Nothing), nor is there emotional reasoning or personalization. Hence, the statement best fits the distortion known as Labeling.",Labeling
2666,They never cared what I felt. I was a failure.,"""They never cared what I felt."" and ""I was a failure.""","The phrase ""They never cared what I felt"" assumes the feelings or thoughts of others without direct evidence, indicating Mind Reading. The statement ""I was a failure"" generalizes one's entire self-worth from perceived past outcomes, which is Labeling. Since the instruction is to classify into one distortion, the dominant distortion in the first sentence is Mind Reading (assuming others' feelings without evidence), and in the second statement, it is Labeling (assigning a global negative label to oneself). Given that the first phrase sets the context and the second is a conclusion about self-worth, the key distortion is Labeling because it leads to a total negative self-assessment.",Labeling
2667,It's none of your business. I don't owe you any money.,"""It's none of your business"", ""I don't owe you any money""","The speaker asserts a strong boundary and denies any financial obligation without presenting evidence or context. The phrase ""I don't owe you any money"" implies a defensive stance, possibly reacting to an accusation or assumption. However, the statement does not include extreme black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), no emotional justification (Emotional Reasoning), no prediction about the future (Fortune-telling), no use of negative labels (Labeling), no exaggeration (Magnification), no focus on a single negative detail (Mental filter), no assumption about others' thoughts (Mind Reading), no broad generalization (Overgeneralization), no assumption that others are responsible (Personalization), and no use of obligatory terms like ""should"".

This reflects an emotional evaluation based purely on feelings (shame) rather than objective facts. The speaker concludes that their lack of earnings equates to being a failure, relying heavily on their emotional state to judge reality.",Emotional Reasoning

I need to know from the beginning.,"""I just don't fit in"", ""I can't make it"", ""I need to know from the beginning""","The phrase ""I just don't fit in"" indicates a broad negative conclusion about oneself based on likely limited experiences, suggesting the perception that the speaker never fits in anywhere. ""I can't make it"" is a definitive negative prediction about their capability to succeed. ""I need to know from the beginning"" shows a need for certainty, possibly stemming from anxiety about unknown outcomes. The primary distortion appears in the sweeping negative conclusions about personal belonging and success, which fits the pattern of overgeneralization—drawing a general conclusion from a few or single events. The definitive negative belief about ability also supports this. Although there is an element of fortune-telling in predicting failure, the main distortion is overgeneralization because the person is making global negative statements about their fit and success.",Overgeneralization
2674,"I am so poor now, and I will be so in the future, and I will be poor all my life.","""I am so poor now"", ""I will be so in the future"", ""I will be poor all my life""","The statement takes a current negative situation (being poor now) and projects it infinitely into the future without evidence, assuming that the situation will never change. This is a classic example of predicting negative outcomes as a certainty, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling'. Although it has elements of overgeneralization by applying the present state to the entire future life, the dominant distortion is the prediction about the future being inevitably negative.",Fortune-telling
2675,My roommates didn't trust me. I was totally deceived.,"""My roommates didn't trust me. I was totally deceived.""","The statement assumes that the roommates' feelings or thoughts (lack of trust) are known to the speaker without direct evidence, which aligns with mind reading. The speaker claims 'I was totally deceived', implying being completely misled or betrayed based on their perception of the roommates' trust. This shows the speaker presumes to understand others' inner thoughts or intentions without confirmation. There is no indication of all-or-nothing, fortune-telling, labeling, magnification, or other distortions primarily present here.

The phrase ""What have I learned from all my years of education?"" implies that all the education was useless, and ""What a failure to live!"" generalizes this feeling to a total failure regarding life. This suggests the person is drawing a sweeping negative conclusion about their entire life and self-worth based on particular circumstances or feelings.

Then the speaker states a global negative self-assessment ('I'm not a good doctor') that labels their entire professional identity based on a single event. Furthermore, the phrase 'Why am I never good enough?' shows a pattern of overgeneralizing a perceived failure to their overall worth. Among the possible distortions, the central theme is taking excessive personal blame ('It's my fault'), indicating Personalization. The self-labeling ('I'm not a good doctor') supports Labeling, but the core distortion is personalization of failure. Overgeneralization is also present but less focal than personalization.

It is important to keep your temper under control and talk to them in peace.,"""Fighting is not a solution to the problem"", ""It is important to keep your temper under control"", ""talk to them in peace""","The statement uses the phrase ""is not a solution"" and ""it is important to"", which are indicative of 'should statements' because it prescribes how things should be done or how one should behave. The speaker implies a rule or standard about controlling temper and resolving conflicts peacefully. There is no evidence of exaggerated thinking, emotional reasoning based solely on feelings, mind reading, or other distortions. The focus is on what should or shouldn't be done, which aligns directly with 'Should statements'.",Should statements
2691,What do you want to know? Why don't you just rip me out of the middle?,"""Why don't you just rip me out of the middle?""","The phrase implies an assumption about what the other person wants or intends without clear evidence, suggesting the speaker believes they understand the other's thoughts or intentions directly. This aligns with 'Mind Reading,' where an individual assumes they know what others are thinking or feeling without explicit communication.",Mind Reading
2692,I'm getting out of my porch. I'm a mean creature. I don't want to see that face anymore!,"""I'm a mean creature"", ""I don't want to see that face anymore""","The phrase ""I'm a mean creature"" is a clear example of labeling, where the person assigns a negative global label to themselves instead of describing the specific behavior or situation. The statement ""I don't want to see that face anymore"" reflects an intense emotional reaction, but the core cognitive distortion is the self-labeling, as the speaker is defining themselves with a negative identity based on feelings or conflict, rather than objective evidence.",Labeling
2693,It's normal for parents to ignore too many children.,"""It's normal for parents to ignore too many children.""","The statement makes a broad generalization about all parents ignoring too many children by saying it is ""normal.""

This reflects blaming external factors for a negative outcome. The phrase 'Must be because...' suggests an assumption about others' behavior or intentions without direct evidence. This aligns with 'Mind Reading,' where the individual assumes to know what others are thinking or doing (spreading false information), affecting the speaker personally.",Mind Reading

I'll forgive the owner for what may be an emergency.,"""It doesn't matter"", ""It's just a little episode"", ""I'll forgive the owner for what may be an emergency""","The statement downplays the significance of the episode by calling it ""just a little episode"" and concludes with forgiveness based on a possible emergency. This reflects an attempt to view the situation in a balanced, non-extreme way, without jumping to negative conclusions or magnifying the problem. The phrase ""what may be an emergency"" also shows an open, tentative perspective rather than a definitive negative judgment. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, magnification, or other distortions. Instead, the speaker accepts uncertainty and chooses a reasonable interpretation.",No Distortion
2697,"I can't help but ask myself, in the eyes of others, if I'm not strong enough for this?","in the eyes of others, if I'm not strong enough for this",The statement focuses on what others might be thinking about the speaker's strength. This involves assuming or guessing the thoughts or judgments of other people without direct evidence. This reflects an attempt to read others' minds rather than basing the conclusion on concrete facts.,Mind Reading
2698,"If Mom and Dad found out I was naked, they'd blame me for being incompetent and unable to protect themselves properly.","If Mom and Dad found out I was naked, they'd blame me for being incompetent and unable to protect themselves properly.","The statement involves assuming what Mom and Dad would think or feel if they found out about the situation, without actual evidence of their thoughts. The person is attributing specific negative thoughts (blaming incompetence) to others, which is characteristic of mind reading. This is different from fortune-telling, which predicts future events rather than others' thoughts or feelings. It is also not all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or personalization, because the focus is on presumed thoughts of others rather than extremes, self-labels, or self-blame directly. Therefore, the most fitting distortion is mind reading.",Mind Reading
2699,Shouldn't the messenger like the boy too? I should really look around.,"""Shouldn't the messenger like the boy too?"" and ""I should really look around.""","The statement contains the word ""shouldn't"" and ""should,"" indicating a belief about how things are expected or ought to be. The speaker expresses an expectation about what the messenger's feelings should be as well as what actions they ""should"" take. This type of thinking involves rigid rules about how oneself or others must behave, which corresponds to 'Should statements' as a cognitive distortion.",Should statements

2701,"The leaders are capitalists, shoplifters, who know nothing but exploitation and oppression, and who work without pay for overtime every day!","leaders are capitalists, shoplifters, who know nothing but exploitation and oppression, and who work without pay for overtime every day","The statement assigns extreme negative labels ('capitalists,' 'shoplifters') to the leaders, implying they possess these negative traits wholly and completely. It also categorizes them as only knowing exploitation and oppression, which is an extreme, black-and-white characterization without nuance. Additionally, it wrongly claims they 'work without pay for overtime every day,' which appears to be an unfounded and absolute claim. The core cognitive distortion is the labeling of the leaders with pejorative terms that devalue their entire character based on negative assumptions.",Labeling

This represents predicting future misfortune and worrying about worst-case scenarios. The focus is on an assumed inevitable future negative event, which aligns with predicting outcomes without certainty.",Fortune-telling
2703,"I have a problem with my body, and that's when I break my bones a little bit. My body is vulnerable.","""I have a problem with my body"", ""I break my bones a little bit"", ""My body is vulnerable.""","The speaker is interpreting physical injury as indicative of a fundamental flaw with their entire body, implying a generalized defect. The phrase ""I have a problem with my body"" sets a broad negative evaluation based on specific incidents of breaking bones. The conclusion ""My body is vulnerable"" reflects a negative global assessment rather than isolated events. This suggests overgeneralizing one or a few incidents to the entire state or nature of the body.",Overgeneralization

They also express a harsh judgment on their physical appearance ('I'm so fat'). Furthermore, they assume that their appearance significantly impacts others negatively ('I must have defiled everyone's eyes'), which suggests an overly negative and generalized self-assessment tied to personal identity. The combination of these elements fits best with 'Labeling', as the speaker assigns negative, fixed labels to themselves rather than considering specific behaviors or circumstances.",Labeling

There is no evidence of negative or irrational thinking patterns such as extreme categorization, emotional assumptions, predicting the future negatively, applying labels, exaggerating, filtering out positive aspects, assuming others' thoughts, making broad generalizations, blaming oneself, or using 'should' statements. Instead, the speaker seems to provide a balanced, realistic view of their circumstances. Therefore, this statement does not reflect any cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
2706,I'll be the best parent ever and make sure Santa is always real in their eyes.,"""I'll be the best parent ever""","The statement expresses a definite and absolute belief about being ""the best parent ever,"" leaving no room for degrees or variations in parenting success.

2707,"Oh, I'm gonna put some gas on it and get it back.","Oh, I'm gonna put some gas on it and get it back.","The statement expresses an intention to take action ('put some gas on it') and an expectation of a specific outcome ('get it back'). There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, labeling, magnification, mental filter, mind reading, overgeneralization, personalization, or should statements. The speaker is simply stating a plan with confidence in the result, without distorting reality or making irrational conclusions. Therefore, this statement does not demonstrate a cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
2708,He stood me up. He stood me up on purpose. Makes me waste my time.,"""He stood me up"", ""He stood me up on purpose"", ""Makes me waste my time""","The statement ""He stood me up on purpose"" reflects an assumption about the other person's intentions without direct evidence, which fits the definition of Mind Reading. The speaker assumes the person deliberately intended to stand them up. There is also an expression of emotional impact in ""Makes me waste my time"", but the key distortion is the assumption about the other person's motive. The other cognitive distortions such as Fortune-telling, Labeling, or Personalization do not fit as well because this is about inferred intent rather than predicting the future, name-calling, or taking excessive responsibility. Therefore, Mind Reading best fits the primary distortion in this statement.",Mind Reading

I can't help it. I have to wash my clothes again.","The speaker is expressing a strong negative emotion about the way the new clothes look and subsequently feels compelled to wash the clothes again. The phrase 'It's so bad' indicates an emotional judgment rather than an objective fact. The conclusion 'I have to wash my clothes again' is driven primarily by this negative feeling. This reflects emotional reasoning because the individual is assuming that their feelings about the clothes being 'bad' dictate the actual necessity to wash them again, without objective evidence that the clothes need washing.",Emotional Reasoning

It assumes that because the recent case is harder and society has changed, the person's prior knowledge will no longer be effective in winning future cases. This shows an anticipation of an unfavorable outcome without certainty, essentially predicting future failure. The focus is on an assumed negative future event rather than an absolute or global judgment about self or others, so it aligns best with 'Fortune-telling' cognitive distortion.",Fortune-telling

The phrase ""I feel so deeply bound up that the whole world is trying to control me"" further exaggerates the scope from one person (Mom) to the entire world, indicating an overextension of a specific event or experience to a broad, global context. This pattern aligns with Overgeneralization, where one negative event or experience is applied universally.",Overgeneralization
2712,I'm so scared of the crash. I don't want to work overtime. It's horrible.,"""I'm so scared of the crash"", ""I don't want to work overtime"", ""It's horrible""","The person expresses fear of a crash, likely an accident, which leads to an aversion to working overtime. The statement ""I'm so scared of the crash"" indicates an expectation of a negative event. This is a prediction about a future event (a crash) without evidence, demonstrating an assumption that the worst will happen. The phrase ""It's horrible"" reflects a negative evaluation of the potential event. The primary cognitive distortion appears to be predicting a negative outcome that has not yet happened, fitting the 'Fortune-telling' distortion.",Fortune-telling

This reflects a black-and-white perspective where anything less than perfect is seen as total failure, without recognizing any middle ground or partial success. Such thinking fits the definition of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where the situation is viewed in extremes rather than a balanced view.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This shows the speaker is 'reading the mind' of another person, assuming negative thoughts or feelings without direct confirmation. The phrase 'I knew he didn't like me' exemplifies Mind Reading, as the speaker infers internal states of another instead of observing facts.",Mind Reading

Additionally, the speaker labels themselves negatively ('I'm a loser'), which corresponds to Labeling. Between these, fortune-telling relates to predicting negative events in the future, while labeling involves assigning a negative identity to oneself. Since the primary focus is on predicting negative events that will happen tomorrow ('you're gonna be late tomorrow' and 'you're gonna be stuck'), fortune-telling is the main distortion here. The self-labeling is present but secondary to the future prediction.",Fortune-telling
2716,Why did she leave suddenly when she told me to eat the breakfast left on the table that morning?,Why did she leave suddenly when she told me to eat the breakfast left on the table that morning?,"The statement involves wondering about the sudden departure of 'she' after giving a seemingly neutral instruction about breakfast. The speaker is trying to infer a causal motive or hidden reasoning behind her departure without concrete evidence, essentially attempting to predict or explain an event based on assumptions rather than facts. This fits the pattern of 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts negative outcomes or motives without sufficient proof.",Fortune-telling
2717,My roommate and I had a fight. I'm so angry!,"""My roommate and I had a fight."" ""I'm so angry!""","The statement expresses a feeling ('I'm so angry!') directly resulting from an event ('My roommate and I had a fight'). The anger is accepted as a valid indication of the situation's negativity without additional evidence or cognitive distortion like overgeneralization or mind reading. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the person assumes their emotional reaction necessarily reflects the truth of the situation.",Emotional Reasoning

The hotel must have done it on purpose.","""The hotel must have done it on purpose.""","The statement assumes the hotel's intentions without evidence, attributing a deliberate motive to their actions. This involves making assumptions about what others are thinking or intending, which fits the definition of Mind Reading. The speaker is not merely interpreting a fact; they are inferring malicious intent from the hotel's action, which is characteristic of this distortion.",Mind Reading

2720,I'm so upset I'm not happy about everything. I've done nothing lately.,"""I'm so upset I'm not happy about everything"", ""I've done nothing lately""","The phrase ""I'm not happy about everything"" suggests a negative focus on a broad range of experiences, indicating that the person is filtering through all the positives and focusing only on negatives. The phrase ""I've done nothing lately"" reflects a sweeping generalization about their recent activities, implying that no positive actions were taken at all. These together demonstrate a pattern where a single negative aspect is generalized to a broader, more absolute conclusion.",Overgeneralization
2721,"Disgruntled, feeling worthless and unloved, like bad things never stop happening to me.","feeling worthless and unloved, like bad things never stop happening to me","The statement includes a negative self-evaluation ('feeling worthless and unloved') which suggests labeling oneself negatively. Additionally, the phrase 'like bad things never stop happening to me' indicates a sweeping negative conclusion about ongoing experiences, implying that the person is making a broad generalization based on current feelings or events. This highlights a tendency to view multiple events through a single negative filter and generalize this negativity over time. Thus, the cognitive distortion is best characterized by 'Overgeneralization', where one infers a broad negative outcome from a specific situation.",Overgeneralization
2722,"Bless them, but I'm still enjoying my own time.","""Bless them"", ""I'm still enjoying my own time""","The phrase 'Bless them' indicates a neutral or even positive acknowledgment of others, while 'I'm still enjoying my own time' highlights a personal focus on one's own situation without negative judgment or distortion.

The statement reflects a balanced and non-distorted perspective.",No Distortion
2723,"I'm an incompetent person, and the company doesn't think I'm right.","""I'm an incompetent person"" and ""the company doesn't think I'm right""","The phrase ""I'm an incompetent person"" is a global negative judgment about the self, which fits the definition of labeling, where one assigns a fixed negative label to oneself. The phrase ""the company doesn't think I'm right"" suggests a belief about others' thoughts without confirmed evidence, which is indicative of mind reading. However, since the task is to choose one single distortion, the dominant distortion appears to be labeling due to the strong self-defining negative label ""incompetent"". This type of negative self-labeling is more central and impactful in the statement than the assumption about the company’s thoughts.",Labeling

""I'm broke in running anything"" reinforces this negative self-assessment. The statement about the cake shop closing due to the epidemic is a contextual fact and does not itself represent a distortion. The primary distortion lies in the global negative self-label of being a ""loser,"" which oversimplifies and defines identity based on current setbacks.",Labeling
2725,I can't even take a test.

The follow-up ""It's a joke"" minimizes the entire situation in a way that suggests the person views their capability in total negative terms, which is characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking. There is no evidence of predicting the future (Fortune-telling), assuming knowledge of others' thoughts (Mind Reading), or filtering information selectively (Mental filter). The statement does not assign a personal trait label explicitly or use emotional reasoning. Therefore, the dominant distortion here is viewing the situation as either complete failure or total incompetence with no middle ground.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

Additionally, 'they saw my situation and could laugh at me' suggests assuming the sisters' thoughts or intentions without evidence. However, the core distortion lies in the sweeping generalization about the sisters' situation, as it applies an absolute category to all without nuance.",Overgeneralization
2727,Why does she want to put everything on my back? Why did she enter the company the same year?,"""Why does she want to put everything on my back?"" and ""Why did she enter the company the same year?""","The speaker assumes the other person intends to blame or burden them without evidence, implying they know the woman's intentions.

This assumes a certain outcome without evidence, predicting the future positively based solely on current busyness. This fits the definition of Fortune-telling, where one predicts future events as certain outcomes without factual basis.",Fortune-telling

""It's a terrible thing to be a farmer.""","The statement expresses emotional pain due to observing the parents' suffering, and then makes a broad negative judgment about being a farmer, calling it a terrible thing. The speaker is drawing a general negative conclusion about the entire profession of farming based on their current emotional experience or observation. This reflects a cognitive distortion where a single negative experience or emotion leads to an extensive negative generalization.",Overgeneralization

I'm sure I'm not strict enough.,"""It's too late to ask for a change""; ""I'm sure I'm not strict enough.""","The statement ""It's too late to ask for a change"" implies a rule or expectation about timing that must be followed, which aligns with 'Should statements' where rigid rules or demands are imposed on oneself or situations. The phrase ""I'm sure I'm not strict enough"" indicates a judgment about personal adequacy based on this perceived rule. However, the core distortion lies in the self-imposed rule about timing ('too late'), reflecting a 'Should statement' rather than other distortions like 'Fortune-telling' or 'Labeling'.",Should statements

It's really broken down.,"""I can't fix this"", ""I can't communicate"", ""It's really broken down""","The phrases indicate a perception that the situation is completely unfixable and communication is impossible. This suggests a black-and-white or all-or-nothing viewpoint without recognizing any possibility of improvement or partial success. The statement does not show jumping to conclusions about the future (fortune-telling), making exaggerated negative judgments about oneself (labeling), or filtering out positive aspects (mental filter).

This shows a negative prediction about future events which aligns with 'Fortune-telling', where one anticipates a negative outcome. While the phrase 'I can't stand' reflects a strong emotional reaction, the key distortion lies in assuming an intensified negative experience in the future.",Fortune-telling

""I didn't study well"" ""now it's my job to lose my mother's company""","The statement reflects a harsh self-judgment with a label ""not a qualified mother,"" indicating labeling. Additionally, the speaker links poor academic performance directly to a major current failure, implying a personalization distortion by blaming themselves for external consequences. However, the core distortion is the use of labeling: assigning a negative fixed identity based on perceived failure. The other parts support the label but do not dominate the statement.",Labeling
2734,"He's new, he hates me. Did someone say something to him about me?","""He's new, he hates me"", ""Did someone say something to him about me?""","The speaker assumes that the new person hates them without concrete evidence and immediately questions if someone influenced this new person's feelings.

2735,"It's horrible. Without grades, my father won't like me anymore, and he certainly won't want me anymore.","""Without grades, my father won't like me anymore""; ""he certainly won't want me anymore""","The statement predicts a negative outcome about the father's feelings without evidence, assuming future rejection if grades are not achieved. This reflects an assumption about future events (father's reaction) without factual basis, which aligns with predicting a negative future outcome. It is not just emotional reasoning (which would be based solely on feelings), nor is it all-or-nothing thinking (which involves absolute terms without gradation). Instead, it fits the definition of Fortune-telling, where the individual is anticipating a rejected future outcome.",Fortune-telling

It's my fault.""","The speaker assumes responsibility for others not calling, indicating they believe their own actions or worth cause this behavior. This reflects taking events personally without evidence that they are at fault. The key cognitive error is blaming oneself for something likely outside one's control, which aligns with Personalization. There is no clear evidence of other distortions such as assuming all-or-nothing outcomes, predicting the future, or labeling. The focus is on self-blame for others' actions.",Personalization

This reflects an absolute, black-and-white way of thinking with no middle ground. Additionally, ""I can't solve the learning difficulties"" generalizes an apparent failure to all circumstances. The phrase ""I'm really not as good as dead"" expresses intense negative self-labeling. Collectively, these indicate extreme negative self-judgment and rigid thinking without nuance, which aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking. Although labeling is present, the primary cognitive distortion is the absolute, dichotomous evaluation characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2738,I'm an expression piece of shit.,"""I'm an expression piece of shit.""","The statement involves assigning a highly negative and global label to oneself based on personal feelings or situation. The phrase 'piece of shit' is a harsh negative label that defines the speaker's entire self-worth. This fits with the cognitive distortion known as 'Labeling,' where a person assigns a negative label to themselves or others based on specific experiences or feelings, rather than a balanced view.",Labeling
2739,"It was difficult for me to absorb this, and until then I had always thought that my father was a good husband and a good father, and that reality had struck me too hard.","""I had always thought that my father was a good husband and a good father"", ""reality had struck me too hard""","The statement reflects a sudden and impactful change in perception about the father, suggesting the speaker experienced a harsh realization that contradicts prior beliefs. However, the statement does not indicate an extreme either/or thinking (all-or-nothing), nor assuming feelings define facts (emotional reasoning), or predicting the future (fortune-telling). It also lacks assigning negative labels to self or others, focusing more on a painful realization. The phrase 'reality had struck me too hard' shows an emotional impact but does not specifically equate feeling with truth. The speaker acknowledges the complexity of the situation rather than filtering or magnifying only negatives or positives. There is no evidence of personalization, should statements, or mind reading. The statement exemplifies an updated belief contradicting previous assumptions but does not clearly fit into classic distortion categories. Given these points, the most fitting distortion relates to Emotional Reasoning—accepting emotional impact as a reflection of truth.",Emotional Reasoning
2740,They make me nervous. It's hard to solve. Why don't you give up?,"""They make me nervous"", ""It's hard to solve"", ""Why don't you give up?""","The statement ""They make me nervous"" is expressing an emotional state as evidence of a situation's nature, implying that because the speaker feels nervous, the situation must be difficult or threatening. This reflects emotional reasoning—using feelings as a justification for an assumed truth. The phrase ""It's hard to solve"" supports this by stating a difficulty presumably inferred from the emotional reaction. The question ""Why don't you give up?"" suggests a conclusion based on that emotional state and perceived difficulty rather than objective evidence. There is no definite fortune-telling or mind reading; no absolute terms for all-or-nothing or labeling; no direct magnification or mental filtering. Therefore, emotional reasoning is the best fit.",Emotional Reasoning

The second phrase, ""I'd rather die if I were to follow this,"" exaggerates the consequences to an extreme, which shows a catastrophic response. Between the two, the more prominent distortion is the absolute, extreme dichotomy—either complete rejection or fatal consequence—highlighting All-or-Nothing Thinking rather than just magnification or emotional reasoning.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2742,"If the only happiness in life really is to love and be loved, no wonder I am so unhappy.","""If the only happiness in life really is to love and be loved"", ""no wonder I am so unhappy""","The statement sets a condition that the only source of happiness is loving and being loved, presenting a very black-and-white (either-or) perspective on happiness. This represents All-or-Nothing Thinking because it ignores any other sources of happiness or complexity in life. The conclusion ""no wonder I am so unhappy"" is based entirely on this rigid condition, showing that the person believes there are no other alternatives for happiness beyond love, which is an absolute perspective.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2743,"The teacher despises me, gives people so much advice, doesn't give me a little guidance, and what can I do with him?","""The teacher despises me"", ""doesn't give me a little guidance""","The statement asserts that the teacher 'despises me' without direct evidence, implying the speaker is assuming the teacher's negative feelings. This represents attributing intentions or thoughts to another person without proof, which aligns with 'Mind Reading'. The other parts such as 'doesn't give me a little guidance' reinforces the negative perception but does not change the primary distortion. Therefore, the key distortion is the assumption of the teacher's feelings and intentions.",Mind Reading
2744,I can't let anyone bully me. I'm going to fight in a legitimate way.,"""I can't let anyone bully me."", ""I'm going to fight in a legitimate way.""","The phrase ""I can't let anyone bully me"" suggests a rigid, absolute stance where the speaker sees the situation in black-and-white terms, implying no tolerance or exceptions. This reflects all-or-nothing thinking, as the person believes they must absolutely not allow bullying, without considering possible nuances or alternative responses. The statement about fighting ""in a legitimate way"" does not indicate distortion but rather a planned response. There is no evidence of other distortions such as emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, labeling, or others in this statement.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2745,"It's frustrating that the conditions are so bad, and maybe my future is for lying in bed and dying.","""maybe my future is for lying in bed and dying""","The statement contains a prediction about the future without concrete evidence, suggesting a negative and pessimistic forecast. The use of 'maybe' implies an assumption about what will happen, which aligns with predicting an unfavorable outcome. This aligns closely with 'Fortune-telling,' where one assumes they know what the future holds, particularly negative events. While there is frustration expressed about the current conditions, the key distortion lies in the negative future prediction rather than other distortions like emotional reasoning or magnification.",Fortune-telling
2746,It's my incompetence to say the wrong thing and make people angry. I hate it.,"""It's my incompetence to say the wrong thing and make people angry.""","The statement attributes the cause of others' anger to the speaker's incompetence, implying that the speaker is personally to blame for how others feel. This reflects taking excessive personal responsibility for external events or others' reactions. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or emotional reasoning alone. Instead, the speaker is personalizing the situation by blaming themselves for others' emotional responses.",Personalization
2747,"We're married. She's good for our family, and she's really gonna do it for me.","'She's good for our family', 'she's really gonna do it for me'","The statement assumes that because they are married, she will inherently be good for the family and fulfill all the speaker's needs or expectations. This reflects an expectation about the future based on present beliefs without evidence, predicting a specific outcome. The phrase 'she's really gonna do it for me' implies predicting a positive future event or behavior from the spouse with certainty.",Fortune-telling
2748,"I've got to do the project, take this opportunity, and use my power to impress them.","I've got to do the project, take this opportunity, and use my power to impress them.","The statement contains the phrase 'I've got to do the project' which implies a sense of obligation or a rule the speaker feels they must follow. 'Take this opportunity' and 'use my power to impress them' suggest the speaker believes they must act in a certain way to achieve a positive outcome. This rigid expectation of how one should behave or what one must do aligns with the cognitive distortion known as 'Should statements,' where individuals impose strict rules on themselves.",Should statements
2749,"I will not look men in the eye, because I fear that they will think that I am “dirty.” I will not look women in the eye, afraid that they will think that I am a grumpy lesbian.

These thoughts assume negative opinions from others in social interactions, which aligns closely with 'Mind Reading'—believing one knows what others think without verification. While there is fear and negative self-perception, the core distortion is the presumption of others' negative thoughts about the speaker.",Mind Reading
2750,"This society is so dark, there's only competition among colleagues, and we'll always be in it.","""This society is so dark"", ""there's only competition among colleagues"", ""we'll always be in it""","The speaker uses absolute terms like 'only' and 'always,' implying no exceptions to the idea that society is entirely negative and competitive. This reflects a cognitive distortion where a complex reality is viewed in an all-or-nothing manner. The phrase 'there's only competition' excludes any possibility of cooperation or other dynamics, and 'we'll always be in it' predicts a permanent, unchanging state, indicative of overgeneralization. The key is that the statement presents an extreme, sweeping judgment about society without nuance.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

""He is the standard of my life."" ""I intend to be an upright man.""","The statement expresses admiration and respect for the father, setting him as a personal standard or role model. The speaker's intention to be upright is aspirational and does not indicate a cognitive bias or distortion. There is no evidence of extreme thinking, negative filtering, or assumptive errors. Instead, it appears as a clear and positive statement of values and goals without distortion.",No Distortion

I don't think I'm going to see the company as inefficient as ever.,"""Why is it so inefficient to work online?"" and ""I don't think I'm going to see the company as inefficient as ever.""","The first phrase implies a negative evaluation of online work as inherently inefficient. The second phrase anticipates a continued negative perception ('as inefficient as ever'), suggesting the speaker is predicting a future outcome based on current feelings or assumptions. This prediction about the future without concrete evidence aligns most closely with 'Fortune-telling.' The statement does not represent all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or other distortions because it doesn't categorize everything in absolute terms, nor does it assign a global negative label to a person or thing. Instead, it conveys a negative prediction about ongoing inefficiency.",Fortune-telling
2753,"Next time he tells me to go out, I won't trust her that much.","""Next time he tells me to go out, I won't trust her that much.""","The statement predicts a future scenario where the speaker assumes that because of a past experience, they will not trust 'her' next time she invites them out, despite lack of concrete evidence that this will happen. This indicates assuming a negative outcome about the future based on current feelings or assumptions. This is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling', where a person predicts future events in a negative way without sufficient evidence.",Fortune-telling
2754,"It's only three o'clock, it's good to have more than three hours of sleep. Sleep is everything for me, and all the other problems can be solved.","""Sleep is everything for me, and all the other problems can be solved.""","The statement places absolute importance on sleep suggesting it is the single most crucial factor ('sleep is everything'), while minimizing or disregarding other problems by claiming they can all be solved. This reflects an extreme, black-and-white perspective without middle ground, which aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking. The person either has sufficient sleep and thus everything is okay, or presumably without it, things are bad.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2755,It's over. I can't lift my head in front of my relatives.,"""It's over."" and ""I can't lift my head in front of my relatives.""","The phrase ""It's over."" suggests a sense of finality and total defeat, indicating a black-and-white perspective without any middle ground. Additionally, ""I can't lift my head in front of my relatives"" implies a strong feeling of shame or failure. The combination shows an extreme evaluation of the situation—viewing it as completely ruined and himself as utterly disgraced. This aligns most closely with All-or-Nothing Thinking, where things are seen in absolutes rather than on a continuum.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2756,"I can't work as hard as everyone else, and I can't achieve much. There is no way out of my future, and everything is over.","""I can't work as hard as everyone else"", ""I can't achieve much"", ""There is no way out of my future"", ""everything is over""","The speaker makes a sweeping negative conclusion about their abilities and future based on their current perception. The phrases indicate a global negative judgment about themselves (inability to work hard and achieve much) extended to their entire future (no way out), suggesting a broad and absolute categorization. This type of thinking fits the distortion where a single negative event or characteristic leads to an all-encompassing negative viewpoint, which is characteristic of Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2757,Maybe my grades aren't enough. I should try harder.,"""Maybe my grades aren't enough."" ""I should try harder.""","The statement ""I should try harder"" reflects the use of 'should statements,' where the speaker imposes a rule or expectation on themselves. This cognitive distortion involves having rigid rules about how one must behave or perform, often leading to guilt or frustration. The phrase ""Maybe my grades aren't enough"" suggests some self-doubt but doesn't clearly fit other distortions like fortune-telling or emotional reasoning here. The core distortion is the 'should' statement that implies a strict internal rule.",Should statements
2758,I'm sorry. It's all my fault. It's me.,"""It's all my fault. It's me.""","The statement places full blame on oneself regardless of actual evidence or external factors. This indicates taking excessive responsibility for an event or outcome. The language does not show black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), nor is it about predicting future events (Fortune-telling) or interpreting others' thoughts (Mind Reading). Instead, the focus is on personalizing the cause of the problem excessively, which corresponds to Personalization.",Personalization
2759,I'll live like this forever. My dreams will never come true. My problems will never be solved.,"""I'll live like this forever."" ""My dreams will never come true."" ""My problems will never be solved.""","The statement predicts a negative outcome with absolute certainty about the future, assuming that current difficulties will continue endlessly without change. This involves making a definitive forecast without evidence, which aligns with expecting a negative future. The distortion is not about all-or-nothing or black-and-white thinking, labeling, or personalization. It specifically represents a prediction about the future that assumes failure and permanence.",Fortune-telling
2760,"I wish I could do this, but I'm not good. I'm useless. I can't do it.","""I'm not good"", ""I'm useless"", ""I can't do it""","The statement contains self-labeling with negative terms ('I'm not good', 'I'm useless'), which are global negative judgments about the self rather than specific behaviors or instances.

2761,"They're helping me on the surface, but I'm tired of it.","""They're helping me on the surface, but I'm tired of it.""","The statement acknowledges that help is being provided ('They're helping me on the surface'), yet expresses a feeling of exhaustion and dissatisfaction despite the help. The phrase 'on the surface' implies that the assistance might be superficial or insufficient. The feeling of being 'tired of it' suggests an emotional response possibly overriding the objective fact of receiving help. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the person's feelings (tiredness, dissatisfaction) are shaping their belief about the help being inadequate or not genuine, rather than relying solely on observable evidence.",Emotional Reasoning
2762,It's too bad my money's gone. I don't need to recover it.,"""It's too bad my money's gone. I don't need to recover it.""","The statement expresses a resigned acceptance of losing money without attempting to change the situation. The key phrase 'I don't need to recover it' suggests a self-imposed limitation or a rule the person believes they must follow. This reflects an internal demand or rule that there is no point in trying to fix the loss, rather than an objective assessment. This aligns with the cognitive distortion where individuals impose 'should' or 'must' rules on themselves or situations, often leading to inflexibility.",Should statements
2763,"My pay is modest, but my desire for material is not strong. This is the happiness of my heart as long as my family laughs around the table.","""My pay is modest"", ""my desire for material is not strong"", ""This is the happiness of my heart"", ""as long as my family laughs around the table""","The statement acknowledges a modest income but balances it by emphasizing low material desire and finds happiness in family togetherness. There is no evidence of extreme black-and-white thinking, negative emotional assumptions, predicting the future, labeling self or others, magnifying negatives, filtering out positives, mind reading, personalizing events, or using 'should' statements. The perspective is balanced and realistic, focusing on current positive aspects and satisfaction. Therefore, it does not fit any cognitive distortion but reflects a healthy outlook.",No Distortion

""I don't make cake."" ""I should've given up this dream sooner.""","The statement contains phrases that express obligation and regret framed as 'I should've given up this dream sooner.' This indicates the use of 'should' statements, where the speaker is criticizing themselves based on perceived expectations or rules about what they ought to have done. Although there is some negativity and self-judgment, it does not fully fit other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking or overgeneralization. The primary distortion is focusing on 'should' in a way that creates emotional pressure and self-criticism.",Should statements
2765,"I really don't want to work here anymore. I want to go somewhere else, but there's no company in the world where the boss can work with his employees.","""there's no company in the world where the boss can work with his employees""","The statement generalizes from a personal dissatisfaction with the current company to a universal claim that no company exists where bosses can work with employees. This is a sweeping conclusion based on limited experience, indicating a broad generalization beyond the evidence. The key phrase 'there's no company in the world' exemplifies this over-extension.",Overgeneralization
2766,"She's a self-centered, self-centered person.","""She's a self-centered, self-centered person.""","The statement uses a highly generalized, negative label applied to the person without any nuance or consideration of specific behaviors or contexts. The repetition emphasizes the labeling, which is a form of putting a fixed, global negative tag on someone rather than describing specific actions. This corresponds to the cognitive distortion known as 'Labeling', where an individual is defined by a negative trait rather than their actions.",Labeling

The speaker is placing a rigid expectation on themselves about what they must do, which is typical of 'Should statements'. While there is evident anxiety and worry, the core cognitive distortion involves imposing a rule or obligation on oneself ('I should'), rather than other distortions such as Emotional Reasoning or Fortune-telling. Therefore, the most fitting label is 'Should statements'.",Should statements

He certainly doesn't like me.,"""He must have liked him."", ""He hasn't looked for me for so long."", ""He certainly doesn't like me.""","The statement ""He must have liked him"" and ""He certainly doesn't like me"" shows the speaker assuming they know what the other person is thinking or feeling without direct evidence. This is a clear case of mind reading, where the speaker infers someone's thoughts or feelings as a fact rather than a possibility. The statement ""He hasn't looked for me for so long"" is an observation, but the conclusion about his feelings is an assumption based purely on presumed knowledge of another’s mind.",Mind Reading
2769,"If you lose this case, no one will ever come to me again, and my career is over.","""If you lose this case"", ""no one will ever come to me again"", ""my career is over""","The statement assumes a definitive negative outcome based on a single event, predicting that losing one case will result in an absolute and permanent loss of future clients and the end of the career. This shows a catastrophic prediction without evidence and treats the situation as if it guarantees the worst possible result. The person is predicting the future negatively (fortune-telling) and exaggerating the consequences (magnification). However, since the focus is on predicting the future outcome without evidence, the primary distortion is fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
2770,I can't do this job. I'm just an abandoned sleeper.,I can't do this job; I'm just an abandoned sleeper.,"The phrase ""I can't do this job"" reflects a definitive negative judgment about one's ability, suggesting an all-or-nothing mindset regarding competence. The term ""abandoned sleeper"" functions as a label that the speaker applies to themselves, implying a fixed and global negative identity rather than a specific behavior or situation. This self-labeling is a hallmark of the 'Labeling' cognitive distortion, where a person assigns a negative label to themselves instead of recognizing the complexity of their experiences. While ""I can't do this job"" may hint at hopelessness, the statement's key cognitive distortion lies in the adoption of the negative label 'abandoned sleeper'.",Labeling
2771,That's great. It's a day to help me lose weight.,It's a day to help me lose weight.,"The statement interprets the day in a particular way that fits a desired outcome, implying that the day's events or circumstances are specifically meant to contribute to weight loss. This suggests the person is assuming future results based on the current situation without concrete evidence, which aligns with predicting an outcome prematurely.",Fortune-telling
2772,I feel terrible. I must have a terminal illness.,"""I feel terrible""; ""I must have a terminal illness""","The statement begins with a negative emotional state ""I feel terrible"" and immediately concludes that this feeling is evidence of having a terminal illness. This reflects Emotional Reasoning because the person is using their emotional state as proof of an objective fact without external evidence. They are not simply feeling bad; they believe the feeling itself is a sign of a serious medical condition, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning rather than Fortune-telling or other distortions.",Emotional Reasoning
2773,I can only watch my dog die and I can't do anything. I'm such an incompetent person.,"""I can only watch my dog die and I can't do anything.""; ""I'm such an incompetent person.""","The first phrase expresses a feeling of helplessness in a specific situation (watching the dog die) and the belief that there is no possible action. The second phrase generalizes this feeling of helplessness into a global negative self-assessment, labeling oneself as 'incompetent.' This is a clear example of labeling, where a specific negative event or feeling is used to assign a broad negative label to the self.",Labeling
2774,"Don't do that, Grandma won't serve, or she won't be able to talk me out of it any more.","Grandma won't serve, or she won't be able to talk me out of it any more","The statement predicts a future outcome ('Grandma won't serve' and 'she won't be able to talk me out of it any more') without concrete evidence. This is a clear example of assuming what will happen in the future without knowing for sure, which fits the definition of Fortune-telling. The speaker assumes negative consequences will occur if the action is taken, based solely on speculation.",Fortune-telling
2775,"I'm sure everyone thinks I'm not good enough to express myself, and I'm gonna be despised.","""I'm sure everyone thinks I'm not good enough to express myself"", ""I'm gonna be despised""","The statement assumes knowledge of what others think without any concrete evidence, indicating that the speaker is reading others' minds. The phrase ""I'm sure everyone thinks..."" reflects the belief that the speaker knows others' opinions, which aligns with mind reading. Additionally, the prediction of being despised implies a negative expectation about future social rejection, but the core distortion is in assuming others' thoughts.",Mind Reading

I can't even cure it.,"""I'm so bad"", ""I can't have this disease"", ""It's going to put an extra burden on my family"", ""I can't even cure it""","The phrase ""I'm so bad"" reflects Labeling, where the person assigns a negative label to themselves. ""I can't have this disease"" shows resistance but is not itself a distortion. ""It's going to put an extra burden on my family"" indicates Magnification, as the person is exaggerating the negative impact of their condition on others. ""I can't even cure it"" points to helplessness but no direct distortion type by itself. However, the dominant distortion here is Labeling due to the self-deprecating global negative judgment ""I'm so bad."" The other thoughts support the negativity but the most representative cognitive distortion is Labeling.",Labeling
2777,I can only lie to myself. It must be some kind of disaster in the future.,"""I can only lie to myself."" and ""It must be some kind of disaster in the future.""","The phrase ""It must be some kind of disaster in the future"" indicates a prediction about future events without evidence, suggesting a negative expectation or assumption. This fits the pattern of 'Fortune-telling,' where a person predicts a negative outcome as inevitable. The phrase ""I can only lie to myself"" conveys self-doubt or harsh self-judgment but does not on its own match any other specific distortion as closely as the prediction of disaster does.",Fortune-telling
2778,"It's normal to trip on a diet, but just try to restrain yourself.","""It's normal to trip on a diet"", ""just try to restrain yourself""","The first part, ""It's normal to trip on a diet,"" acknowledges that setbacks happen, which is realistic and not distorted. The second part, ""just try to restrain yourself,"" uses the word ""just"" and implies an expectation or rule about behavior, suggesting a command or guideline. This aligns with 'Should statements', where one imposes expectations on oneself or others, potentially leading to feelings of guilt or failure if not met.",Should statements
2779,My friends don't want to play with me because they don't think I'm good at it.,"""My friends don't want to play with me"" and ""because they don't think I'm good at it.""","The statement assumes the friends' motivations and thoughts without concrete evidence; it presumes to know what others are thinking. This fits the definition of Mind Reading, where one believes they know the thoughts or feelings of others without verification. Other distortions like Fortune-telling could involve predicting future events, but here it concerns presumed beliefs in the present. Emotional reasoning would involve basing truth on feelings, which is not clearly present. Labeling or Overgeneralization would involve negative global judgments or broad conclusions, which is not the primary issue here.",Mind Reading
2780,"The leadership must have been trying to criticize me for using excuses against me, and they were all evil people.","""The leadership must have been trying to criticize me""; ""they were all evil people.""","The statement assumes the leadership's intent without evidence, implying an ability to read their minds ('must have been trying to criticize me'). It also applies an extreme negative label to a whole group ('they were all evil people'), which is a form of labeling. However, the initial assumption about the leadership's intentions is a clear example of mind reading, as it attributes thoughts and motives without confirmation.",Mind Reading
2781,"Well, maybe I can think of something like that. Maybe this company doesn't meet my requirements.","""maybe I can think of something like that"", ""maybe this company doesn't meet my requirements""","The speaker is making a prediction about a future event without evidence, using words like 'maybe' to speculate what might happen or be true about the company and their potential fit. This reflects an assumption about the future outcome without certainty. It is not an absolute thinking error (All-or-Nothing), nor is the speaker interpreting emotions as facts (Emotional Reasoning) or assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading). The statement does not express an extreme personal label or apply a filter to only negative or positive information. Instead, it represents forecasting the future without evidence, consistent with Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

I'm a bad mother to them.","""Maybe they don't miss me."", ""I'm busy."", ""I'm a bad mother to them.""","The sentence 'Maybe they don't miss me' shows an assumption about what others think without evidence, which hints at mind reading. The statement 'I'm busy' provides a reason, but 'I'm a bad mother to them' reflects a self-label based on the assumption. Labeling involves attaching a negative global label to oneself based on specific circumstances or feelings. Here, the person is labeling themselves as 'a bad mother,' which is a clear example of labeling. Although mind reading is present, the core distortion is labeling due to the strong negative self-description.",Labeling
2783,I'm sure I'll never find anyone. I can't get married.,"""I'm sure I'll never find anyone."" ""I can't get married.""","The speaker confidently predicts a negative future outcome ('never find anyone' and 'can't get married') without evidence. This matches the definition of Fortune-telling, which involves anticipating negative events as certain. The statement is not simply an all-or-nothing evaluation because it is about future prediction, not about a binary personal trait. It is not overgeneralization because it focuses on a specific future event rather than multiple instances. It is not emotional reasoning since no emotions are used as evidence. Thus, the cognitive distortion is Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

Or is it a bad spring show?""","The statement questions the need for someone to be a 'talent performer' and contrasts it with unrelated positive or negative experiences ('a good night's meal', 'a bad spring show'). This suggests the speaker is making assumptions about the person's role or performance to fit either perfect talent or failure scenarios, without middle ground or nuance. However, it does not clearly involve judging everything as completely good or bad, nor does it involve predicting the future (fortune-telling), reading minds, or using emotional reasoning directly. It also does not state what the person 'should' do, nor label them explicitly, nor personalize events. The questioning implies a dichotomy between being a talented performer or having something lesser, which aligns somewhat with black-or-white evaluations characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking. The user appears to insist on categories with no room for a moderate or mixed outcome.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This indicates a pattern where the person is making a sweeping conclusion based on limited evidence, treating all instances as uniformly unsuccessful. This is characteristic of overgeneralization, where one negative outcome is generalized to all similar situations.",Overgeneralization

This reflects taking undue personal responsibility for external events. This matches the definition of Personalization, where one assumes personal responsibility for events outside their control. It is not All-or-Nothing Thinking because there is no clear dichotomy in thinking other than blame; it is not Emotional Reasoning as no feelings are used to justify the belief; it is not Fortune-telling or Mind Reading as no predictions or assumptions about others' thoughts are made; it is not Labeling or Magnification since the speaker is not defining self-worth or exaggerating per se; it is not Mental Filter because the statement encompasses the whole event, not focusing on a single detail; it is not Overgeneralization given there is no broad conclusion about other incidents; it is not a Should statement since no explicit 'should' phrase is mentioned.",Personalization
2787,I'm a sick son of a bitch.,"""I'm a sick son of a bitch.""","The statement involves the speaker applying a harsh, negative label to themselves using a derogatory term. This reflects a form of cognitive distortion where complex aspects of oneself are reduced to a simple, negative label without considering nuances or other qualities. This fits best with the 'Labeling' distortion, where a person globally assigns a negative label to themselves or others.",Labeling

The speaker is generalizing their entire experience or performance in a broad, absolute way by implying total and exclusive failure. This indicates a pattern of drawing a broad conclusion from limited evidence or experience.",Overgeneralization
2792,"After a fracture, I walk by crutches every day, and it seems that I will only live with crutches for the rest of my life.","""I will only live with crutches for the rest of my life.""","The key phrase indicates a prediction about the future that is negative and without concrete evidence.

I've never had a chance to get back in my life.","""If this investment fails"", ""everyone will think I'm a loser"", ""I've never had a chance to get back in my life""","The statement assumes a negative future event ('If this investment fails') will lead to a global negative judgment from others ('everyone will think I'm a loser'). This reflects 'mind reading' where the person presumes to know what others think without evidence. Additionally, the phrase 'I've never had a chance to get back in my life' generalizes this perceived failure to their entire life situation, indicating overgeneralization. However, since the core distortion centers on predicting others' negative thoughts about them, 'Mind Reading' is the primary distortion here.",Mind Reading

2795,"I am a burden in the lives of my parents, and I should take full responsibility for their hard work.","""I am a burden in the lives of my parents"", ""I should take full responsibility for their hard work""","The statement contains a clear use of 'should', indicating a sense of obligation or a rigid rule the speaker believes must be followed. The phrase 'I should take full responsibility' exemplifies a 'Should statement' cognitive distortion, where the person imposes strict standards or expectations on themselves. Although the first part implies negative labeling ('I am a burden'), the dominant distortion driving the emotional response is the 'should' statement, as it creates undue pressure and guilt. Therefore, the key distortion here is 'Should statements.'",Should statements
2796,"I don't like it when people say they give me a chance, because it always makes me feel like it's my fault again.","""it always makes me feel like it's my fault again""","The statement shows that the person interprets others saying they 'give me a chance' as an indication that the fault lies with them. This reflects an internal attribution of blame without external evidence, which aligns with the concept of personalization — taking responsibility for events that are not entirely under one's control. There is no indication of extreme thinking (all-or-nothing), prediction of the future (fortune-telling), or filtering out positives, so other distortions are less relevant here.",Personalization
2797,"If I could talk to them, I'd fight and hurt them. I'm a piece of shit. I don't deserve to live.","""I'm a piece of shit.

The individual attributes their self-worth to an extremely harsh and degrading term, rather than focusing on specific behaviors or situations. This is different from all-or-nothing thinking because it is a generalized negative label rather than black-and-white evaluation of events. It also isn't fortune-telling or mind-reading since there is no prediction of future events or assumptions about others' thoughts. The statement about not deserving to live stems from this negative self-labeling.",Labeling

I'll never do that again.,"""I'm a little out of line"", ""Dad's worried about me"", ""I'll never do that again""","The phrase ""I'll never do that again"" indicates a resolution based on a singular event, implying an absolute and rigid conclusion rather than considering a range of future possibilities. This represents an 'all-or-nothing' perspective where the person believes that if something went wrong once, it should never happen again, showing a black-and-white thinking pattern.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

""I'm afraid I'm not going on the road even if I'm tripping.""","The speaker dismisses the idea of going on the road despite possible interest or circumstances ('I'm afraid I'm not going on the road...'). This shows a rigid, black-and-white thinking pattern without considering middle ground options or possibilities. The phrase 'That's not my thing' indicates a categorical rejection based on a single criterion, aligning with the tendency of all-or-nothing thinking where things are seen strictly as one way or another, without nuance.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2800,I should have called the police right now!,"""I should have called the police right now!""","The statement uses the word 'should,' indicating a self-imposed rule or expectation about what the speaker believes they were obligated to do. This phrasing suggests a cognitive distortion where the person is holding themselves to a rigid standard or expectation, often leading to feelings of guilt or frustration if the expectation is unmet. The distortion focuses on 'should' statements, which involve imposing unrealistic or strict demands on oneself or others.",Should statements
2801,I can't fix the dog's death. I'll always be sad.,I can't fix the dog's death. I'll always be sad.,"The statement includes a belief that the sadness will persist indefinitely ('I'll always be sad'), which involves making a definitive negative prediction about the future without evidence. This indicates a cognitive distortion related to predicting an inevitable negative outcome. The first part ('I can't fix the dog's death') reflects acceptance of the event's permanence, but the focus is on the unchangeable future emotional state. This aligns most closely with 'Fortune-telling', where a person predicts an unpleasant future with certainty.",Fortune-telling
2802,What he said to me was because I was so bad.,"""What he said to me was because I was so bad.""","The statement interprets another person's behavior or words as a direct consequence of the speaker's own perceived badness. This shows the speaker blaming themselves for the other person's action or words without objective evidence. It involves taking responsibility for something that might not be directly caused by them, which aligns with Personalization. It is not All-or-Nothing Thinking, Emotional Reasoning (which focuses on feelings as proof), Fortune-telling (predicting future), Labeling (assigning fixed negative traits), Magnification, Mental Filter, Mind Reading (assuming others' thoughts without evidence), Overgeneralization, or Should statements. The key cognitive distortion here is Personalization.",Personalization

These phrases assign a negative global label to oneself rather than addressing specific behaviors or situations. The speaker is categorizing themselves in a fixed and negative way based on perceived shortcomings, which fits the definition of Labeling. The other parts of the statement express feelings of confusion or being stuck but do not strongly indicate distortions like Fortune-telling or All-or-Nothing Thinking.",Labeling

It then asserts a positive self-perception ('I'm the most neutral person who can reconcile'), implying an absolute stance on the speaker's neutrality and capability to manage conflicting emotions. This reflects an all-or-nothing perspective where emotions are seen as either invalid or the speaker is seen as completely neutral and reconciling without acknowledging nuance. There's a polarization between invalidating emotions and positioning oneself as a perfect neutral arbitrator, fitting the pattern of All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This involves making a negative prediction about the future without evidence, fitting the distortion known as Fortune-telling.

I want to wipe out that part myself.,"""I'm not perfect"", ""I want to wipe out that part myself""","The phrase ""I'm not perfect"" acknowledges imperfection but doesn't necessarily denote a distortion. The desire to ""wipe out that part myself"" indicates a personal responsibility or self-correction intention. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, labeling, magnification, mental filter, mind reading, overgeneralization, personalization, or should statements here.

The key cognitive distortion here involves an implicit 'should'—the belief that money should be available to have the big wedding. There is no absolute or extreme thinking (ruling out All-or-Nothing), no assumption about others' thoughts (ruling out Mind Reading), no prediction of the future outcome as a certainty (ruling out Fortune-telling), and no exaggeration or filtering of information. Instead, this revolves around an expectation or a 'should' regarding financial circumstance and wedding plans.",Should statements

However, it immediately balances this by highlighting positive outcomes—learning new knowledge and feeling happy. This indicates the speaker is acknowledging both negative and positive aspects of their experience without distorting the reality. There is no evidence of extremes (all-or-nothing), unfounded assumptions, emotional reasoning, or other distortions. The viewpoint is balanced and realistic.",No Distortion

It also includes a prediction about what the parents will do ('will, of course, pay more attention to them') and an absolute prediction of future failure ('I will never be able to keep up'), indicative of 'Fortune-telling'. However, the predominant cognitive distortion is the use of a strong negative label to define oneself globally. The comparisons to siblings and assumptions about parental attention reinforce this negative labeling. Although elements of fortune-telling are present, the core distortion is labeling because the speaker uses a derogatory label ('loser') to describe themselves and bases other thoughts on this label.",Labeling
2813,"Someone said something bad about me, so he didn't want to talk to me anymore.","""Someone said something bad about me"", ""he didn't want to talk to me anymore""","The statement assumes the reason for the person not wanting to talk is because they said something bad about the speaker. This reflects the belief that the other person’s thoughts or feelings are known without direct evidence.

Additionally, 'grotesque shame' is an exaggerated emotional response, but the core cognitive distortion here is the emotional reasoning, as the speaker believes the anger (an emotion) justifies or predicts their actions (speeding into a car). There is no clear evidence of other distortions like Fortune-telling or Mind Reading in this statement.",Emotional Reasoning

This reflects a generalization of incapacity and exhaustion, suggesting that the speaker believes their situation is universally negative without exception. The phrase ""I can't do anything"" extends the feeling of tiredness to a broad inability, which is characteristic of overgeneralization—drawing a broad conclusion based on limited evidence (being tired at this moment) and applying it to the overall ability to act.",Overgeneralization
2818,My abilities are so bad that I didn't work hard enough when I studied before and now I can't find a job.,My abilities are so bad; I didn't work hard enough when I studied before; now I can't find a job.,"The statement generalizes a single past experience (not finding a job now after previously studying and not working hard enough) to a global, negative judgment about the self ('My abilities are so bad'). This reflects drawing a broad conclusion about one's overall abilities based on limited evidence of past effort and current job status. It does not display absolute extremes (all-or-nothing), emotional assumptions, or predictions about the future, but rather a negative generalization from specific events.",Overgeneralization

The phrase labeling the other individual as 'maggots in the ditch' is a classic example of labeling, where a person is assigned a negative, demeaning trait or identity. Although the statement contains emotional content and some struggle, the core cognitive distortion is labeling due to the explicit name-calling with a negative metaphor.",Labeling
2820,"Parents have their own problems to solve, and I want to do my job well and not cause them any problems.","Parents have their own problems to solve, and I want to do my job well and not cause them any problems.","The statement reflects the belief that the speaker must avoid causing problems for their parents because the parents already have their own problems. This suggests an internal rule or expectation about how the speaker 'should' behave to avoid adding burden to others. The phrase 'I want to do my job well and not cause them any problems' indicates an expectation tied to responsibility and behavior, characteristic of 'Should statements' where the individual imposes rigid rules or expectations on themselves or others.",Should statements
2821,I'm a son of a bitch.,"""I'm a son of a bitch.""","The phrase is a negative label the speaker assigns to themselves. It is an example of labeling because the individual is defining their entire self-worth or identity based on a derogatory term. This is not an example of all-or-nothing thinking, which involves viewing things in black-and-white terms, nor is it emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, or any other distortion listed. The statement does not involve predicting the future, filtering out positive information, or using 'should' statements.

The phrase implies a prediction that the circumstances will remain unfavorable despite the presence of a stand nearby, reflecting a negative expectation about the future. This aligns with Fortune-telling, where someone predicts something negative will happen despite contrary evidence.",Fortune-telling

This is a classic example of Fortune-telling, where the person predicts a negative outcome without evidence. The phrase 'I can't make a deal' also suggests a sense of helplessness based on current feelings ('I'm tired enough'), which supports emotional reasoning but the key distortion is the prediction about the future outcome. 'It's not worse than it is now' reflects resignation rather than distortion. Thus, the main cognitive distortion here is Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

""Whatever it is, let's just fuck it up."" shows a dismissive, emotionally charged response rather than a calm, rational approach. The speaker's judgment is based primarily on their emotional disturbance ('damn', 'annoying'), which is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning — interpreting a situation based on how one feels rather than objective evidence.",Emotional Reasoning

This reflects a black-and-white perspective, characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where things are seen in absolute terms. The phrase 'just for their own good' attempts to justify this absolute negative appraisal but doesn't change the core distortion. There is no evidence of prediction about the future (Fortune-telling), attributing one's own feelings to others without evidence (Mind Reading), or selective focus on negative details (Mental filter).

The phrase ""I'm sure it's hard to do well in the legal arena"" expresses a belief about difficulty based on feeling anxious rather than evidential reasoning. Finally, ""This case may be lost"" is a prediction of a negative outcome without concrete proof. The key distortion here is relying on the emotional state of anxiety to conclude that success is unlikely and the case may be lost, reflecting emotional reasoning where feelings guide conclusions rather than objective evidence. While ""This case may be lost"" could suggest fortune-telling, the dominant pattern is emotional reasoning because the anxious feeling is causing the negative conclusion about the case.",Emotional Reasoning

It also includes an assumed cause-and-effect relationship ('because I made the boss upset'), which exemplifies Personalization. The speaker is taking responsibility for the boss's anger and the co-worker getting scolded, which likely involves blaming oneself unjustifiably. Although there is some element of Mind Reading in assuming the boss's feelings, the core distortion is Personalization as the speaker internalizes blame unnecessarily.",Personalization

Additionally, there is a sense of hopelessness and an all-encompassing negative self-judgment about one's abilities and future satisfaction in the environment, suggesting a rigid negative identity. The mention of extreme measures to satisfy others also conveys emotional distress but is not a distortion type itself.

I spend too little time studying, and I feel sorry for myself every time I mess up.","""It doesn't make sense that I don't study well."", ""I spend too little time studying."", ""I feel sorry for myself every time I mess up.""","The speaker is focusing on their perceived lack of study time and correlating it directly with poor studying results, showing a self-critical perspective. The phrase ""I feel sorry for myself every time I mess up"" reflects emotional reasoning, where feelings of failure are used as evidence that studying is ineffective. The statement expresses a connection between emotions (feeling sorry) and the objective quality of studying, rather than relying on factual evidence. Other distortions like 'Should statements' or 'Personalization' are less fitting, as there is no explicit 'should' or blaming others seen here. The focus on feelings as proof of reality aligns best with Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

The phrase ""If I put it in place, I wouldn't be able to find it"" predicts a negative outcome without evidence, aligning with Fortune-telling. The final phrase ""I'm useless"" is a global negative self-label, indicating Labeling. Among these, the strongest distortion is Labeling, as the speaker assigns a broad negative identity to themselves based on the situation, rather than just blaming or predicting outcomes.",Labeling
2844,Maybe we could introduce these friends to each other. We'll have a great time together.,Maybe we could introduce these friends to each other. We'll have a great time together.,"The statement suggests a possibility ('Maybe') and an optimistic prediction about the outcome ('We'll have a great time together'). There is no absolute or polarized thinking, no negative emotional judgment, no arbitrary labeling, nor an exaggerated negative or positive outcome. The speaker is making a positive forecast about the social interaction, but this forecast is based on hope rather than certainty. This aligns with 'Fortune-telling' because it involves predicting a future event without concrete evidence.",Fortune-telling
2845,"I'm like a cold-blooded animal, indifferent to girlfriends, focused on learning.","""I'm like a cold-blooded animal"", ""indifferent to girlfriends"", ""focused on learning""","The speaker labels themselves as a ""cold-blooded animal,"" which is a global, negative label implying emotional detachment and lack of caring. This type of labeling is when someone assigns a fixed, often negative, identity to themselves or others based on one aspect or perception. It goes beyond describing behavior or feelings and instead assigns a harsh, generalized judgment. The other parts of the sentence support this identity statement but the primary distortion is in the labeling of self.",Labeling

I'm ashamed of them.,"""My parents and children must be disappointed in me"", ""I can't make any money"", ""I'm ashamed of them""","The statement ""My parents and children must be disappointed in me"" reflects an assumption about what others are thinking, without actual evidence. This indicates the use of 'Mind Reading', where the speaker presumes to know the thoughts or feelings of others. Although the statement ""I can't make any money"" expresses a personal failure, and ""I'm ashamed of them"" expresses an emotion, the primary distortion here is the assumption about others' emotions or thoughts without concrete proof.",Mind Reading

Although it acknowledges a potential improvement later ('It'll be better this afternoon'), the overall sentiment remains negative ('still not happy'). This reflects an all-or-nothing perspective, focusing on failure or lack of complete success instead of partial progress. The statement is not about predicting the future without evidence (fortune-telling), nor does it rely solely on feelings as truth (emotional reasoning). It also doesn't involve labeling, magnification, mental filter, mind reading, personalization, or should statements. Thus, the distortion is best categorized as All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

""I wish I could do better on the spot.""","The statement expresses an internal expectation of how the person should be performing, indicated by ""I'm supposed to do"" and ""I wish I could do better."" This reflects a rigid set of rules or demands on oneself. The phrase ""I'm supposed to do"" aligns directly with 'Should statements,' where individuals impose strict expectations on their behavior or performance. There is no clear evidence of exaggeration (Magnification), negative labeling, predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or interpreting others' thoughts (Mind Reading).

This fits the definition of Mind Reading, where one assumes they know what others think or feel. The following statement ""I'm really busy with these things right now"" provides context but does not change the cognitive distortion type. The other listed distortions such as All-or-Nothing Thinking or Emotional Reasoning do not directly match this assumption about another's understanding.",Mind Reading

I can't change it.","""I'm a social threat"", ""I'm just like this"", ""I can't change it""","The statement ""I'm a social threat"" indicates a negative, fixed label placed on oneself, which aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Labeling. Additionally, ""I'm just like this"" and ""I can't change it"" suggest a rigid, unchangeable self-identity. This is not simply an overgeneralization or emotional reasoning because the speaker is applying a global and negative label to themselves rather than making a specific conclusion based on emotions or predicting future events. The key is the assignment of a global negative label ('social threat'), which fits the Labeling distortion best.",Labeling
2854,"I can't bear this. I'm sorry, baby. I'm not a qualified mother.","""I can't bear this."" ""I'm not a qualified mother.""","The phrase ""I can't bear this"" reflects an emotional response and assumes the feeling is a fact about the situation. The statement ""I'm not a qualified mother"" is a negative self-label without evidence, reflecting a critical global self-assessment. The combination shows that the speaker is using their distressing emotions as proof of an objective truth (emotional reasoning) and labeling themselves negatively (labeling). However, the dominant distortion is the self-labeling ""I'm not a qualified mother,"" which is a definitive, global negative label applied to the self based on emotional distress rather than evidence.",Labeling

The statement ""I'm the only one who can't get involved"" indicates a perception of complete exclusion, an absolute condition without exception, which signals all-or-nothing thinking. The expectation ""They're supposed to talk about me"" reflects an assumption about others' intentions, possibly indicating mind reading, but it is less dominant here compared to the sweeping generalizations. The strongest distortion overall is the black-and-white thinking about inclusion and exclusion, characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The phrase ""cuts all the ropes"" and ""lets me fall"" further intensifies the catastrophic view. This shows a pattern of thinking in terms of extremes and absolutes, characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking. The mention of suicidal thoughts highlights the emotional pain but does not itself define the distortion type beyond the extreme negative evaluation.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2861,"For the sake of discord in the dormitory, I bear it all alone. Whether I disagree or misunderstand, I always feel responsible.",I bear it all alone; I always feel responsible,"The statement shows the person taking full responsibility for discord regardless of their own feelings or misunderstandings.

This involves predicting a negative outcome as a definite fact without proof. The speaker assumes they know the future or the person's inability, which aligns with predicting something bad will happen. This fits the definition of fortune-telling, where one predicts negative outcomes as certain.",Fortune-telling
2864,I can't stand a lot of work. I'm full of crap.,"""I can't stand a lot of work""; ""I'm full of crap""","The statement ""I can't stand a lot of work"" expresses a strong negative emotional reaction to a situation but is more of a personal feeling rather than a cognitive distortion on its own. The phrase ""I'm full of crap"" is a direct negative self-label, which is a classic example of labeling—a cognitive distortion where one assigns a negative global label to oneself instead of considering more nuanced traits or behaviors. This is not an overgeneralization or all-or-nothing thinking because it does not generalize from one event or describe extremes, but rather it attaches a harsh, negative label to the self. It is not emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, or other distortions based on the content.",Labeling
2865,The boss gave me such high expectations that I couldn't even overcome the difficulty of dizziness. I'm a useless subordinate.,"""I couldn't even overcome the difficulty of dizziness"", ""I'm a useless subordinate""","The statement transitions from a specific difficulty (feeling dizzy under high expectations) to a harsh global judgment about the self (useless subordinate). This indicates the speaker is taking one negative experience and applying it broadly to their entire self-worth, which is characteristic of overgeneralization and labeling. However, the primary cognitive distortion evident here is 'Labeling' because the speaker assigns a negative, global label ('useless') to themselves based on a single experience rather than a balanced evaluation.",Labeling
2866,This company doesn't want me. I'm nothing. My college degree is a waste.,"""This company doesn't want me."" ""I'm nothing."" ""My college degree is a waste.""",The speaker takes a single negative event or circumstance (implied rejection by a company) and applies it broadly to their entire self-worth ('I'm nothing') and the value of their education ('My college degree is a waste'). This reflects drawing a general conclusion based on limited evidence. The statement generalizes one specific outcome to a universal negative judgment.,Overgeneralization
2867,All my colleagues will laugh at me when they're working with coffee stains.,All my colleagues will laugh at me,"The statement assumes knowledge of others' thoughts and reactions without evidence; it predicts a negative social outcome as if it is definite. This involves claiming to know what others think (they will laugh) which fits the mind reading distortion. It is not fortune-telling broadly since it focuses specifically on others' thoughts rather than general future events. It is not all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or personalization directly.",Mind Reading
2868,I'm no use to people like me who are not determined in their choice of anything.,"""I'm no use to people like me who are not determined in their choice of anything.""","The statement implies a broad generalization about the speaker's self-worth based on a perceived group characteristic ('people like me who are not determined'). It reflects a sweeping judgment that the speaker is 'no use' to this group, suggesting an overextension from a specific trait (lack of determination) to a global negative conclusion about usefulness. This fits the pattern of overgeneralization, where a single or few instances lead to a broad, absolute conclusion.",Overgeneralization

I must be a hopeless loser.,"""I'm such a loser"", ""no one in the world can ever get down like me"", ""I must be a hopeless loser""","The key phrases demonstrate a negative global self-assessment and a harsh, absolute label applied to the self. The speaker categorizes themselves with a fixed negative identity ('loser', 'hopeless loser'), which goes beyond describing a single behavior or event. This is a textbook example of 'Labeling', where identity is defined by a negative term rather than situational specifics. The statement also contains elements of Overgeneralization ('no one in the world can ever get down like me') but the most prominent distortion is the rigid, all-encompassing label assigned to the self.",Labeling
2871,"My roommate stopped being friends with me, probably because I didn't do well enough in some respects.","""My roommate stopped being friends with me"", ""probably because I didn't do well enough in some respects""","The statement assumes the roommate ended the friendship due to a personal failing of the speaker, without concrete evidence.

2872,There's always something like this going on. It's never going to end.,"""There's always something like this going on."" ""It's never going to end.""","The statement includes the word 'always' implying that the event is constant and unending, which generalizes the situation beyond the current context. The phrase 'never going to end' further solidifies this overgeneralization by predicting a perpetual continuation of the problem without exceptions. This fits the distortion type where a single or few events are generalized to an overall pattern.",Overgeneralization
2873,"Fortunately, the teacher asked for this PPT tomorrow. I still remember how to write it. Write it again.","Fortunately, the teacher asked for this PPT tomorrow. I still remember how to write it.",The speaker assumes they will be able to complete the PPT just because they still remember how to write it. There is an assumption about a future event (completing the PPT on time) based on current memory without considering possible obstacles or changes. This reflects predicting a future event without certainty.,Fortune-telling
2874,"The boss was trying to get rid of me, so he kept me working.","""The boss was trying to get rid of me"", ""he kept me working""","The statement assumes the boss's intention (trying to get rid of me) without direct evidence, inferring the boss's thoughts and motives. This reflects 'Mind Reading' because the speaker is attributing a negative intent to the boss based solely on their own interpretation of the situation. The phrase 'he kept me working' is taken as proof of the presumed intention, but it could have other explanations. Hence, this is an example of reading someone else's mind rather than considering alternative possibilities.",Mind Reading
2875,Contradiction with roommates is not all of life. It doesn't have to worry too much about it.,Contradiction with roommates is not all of life. It doesn't have to worry too much about it.,"The speaker acknowledges that conflicts with roommates do not define their entire life and suggests there is no need to worry excessively about it. This indicates a balanced view rather than an extreme, distorted negative interpretation. There is no evidence of overgeneralization, labeling, or emotional reasoning. Instead, the speaker is minimizing the significance of the conflict, which counters distortion. Therefore, this statement does not demonstrate any cognitive distortion but rather a healthy perspective.",No Distortion

We're gonna have to go to the hospital and get rabies.,"""It's bad luck to be bitten by a dog!"" and ""We're gonna have to go to the hospital and get rabies.""","The statement assumes a negative outcome (going to the hospital and getting rabies) as an inevitable consequence of being bitten by a dog, which is a form of predicting a future event without sufficient evidence. This fits the pattern of 'Fortune-telling,' where the person predicts something bad will definitely happen just because of one event (dog bite). There is also a slight exaggeration of the outcome, but the main distortion is the prediction of negative events rather than magnifying or emotional reasoning.",Fortune-telling
2878,How can I be such a piece of shit that I can't even get what I want?,"""How can I be such a piece of shit that I can't even get what I want?""","The statement involves a harsh and global negative self-label ('piece of shit'), which reflects an extreme evaluation of the self based on a specific circumstance.

The phrase ""I'm a loser"" exemplifies assigning a negative label to oneself rather than describing specific behaviors or events. Additionally, ""I'll never make it"" extends this negative judgment into a prediction about the future. While there is an element of fortune-telling, the core distortion lies in the use of a negative label to define the entire self. Therefore, the dominant cognitive distortion is Labeling.",Labeling

Maybe I should quit.,"""I'm the best in the team"", ""It's so frustrating"", ""Maybe I should quit""","The speaker claims to be the best in the team but then expresses frustration and considers quitting. The phrase ""Maybe I should quit"" indicates a self-imposed demand or expectation. This suggests the presence of a ""should statement"" distortion, where the person uses rigid rules or internal commands (e.g., 'I should not feel frustrated' or 'If I'm the best, I shouldn't be frustrated or feel like quitting'). The statement does not show extreme polarization (all-or-nothing), nor predicting the future (fortune-telling), nor labeling, nor magnification, nor filtering. It also does not demonstrate personalization or mind reading. The strongest distortion is the implicit 'should' or expectation leading to frustration and quitting thought.",Should statements

Wine isn't a good thing!""","The speaker is focusing on the personal relationship and how they are being treated by their father, implying a sense of unfair or inappropriate treatment due to their familial connection. The phrase 'I'm his son. How can he treat me like this?' suggests they believe the father’s treatment should be different simply based on their relationship, which can indicate a personalization distortion, where the individual assumes responsibility or a special significance related to others' actions. The statement 'Wine isn't a good thing!' is a judgment but does not strongly indicate other distortions such as all-or-nothing thinking or labeling. The core distortion comes from interpreting the behavior as a personal affront specifically because of being the son.",Personalization

This reflects predicting a negative future event without actual evidence, which matches the distortion called 'Fortune-telling'. It is not mind reading because the speaker is not assuming they know classmates' thoughts or feelings directly, but rather predicting an outcome. It is not labeling or magnification since the statement does not assign a negative label or exaggerate a detail. It is not emotional reasoning because the statement does not reference feelings as evidence. Thus, the best fit is 'Fortune-telling'.",Fortune-telling

This is a broad and extreme generalization from one isolated incident to one's entire self-value. The focus on the label 'worthless' applied to the self indicates a cognitive distortion where a single failure is generalized to characterize the whole person negatively.

It's not too late.,"""We eat together every day"", ""It's not too late.""","The statement begins with a factual observation ""We eat together every day,"" which suggests a positive ongoing action. The second part, ""It's not too late,"" implies reassurance and optimism about a situation or possibility. There is no evidence of exaggerated negative thinking or distorted interpretation of facts. The sentence does not contain all-or-nothing extremes, no assumptions about others' thoughts, no predicting the future negatively or positively beyond the optimistic statement, no labeling, personal blame, or unrealistic rules. Instead, it reflects a balanced view without cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
2893,I'm crazy. I'm insane. Why are you telling them this?,"""I'm crazy. I'm insane.""","The speaker is assigning negative and extreme labels to themselves based on their perception or emotions.

2894,I'm sick of this. I'll never be better. I'll always be a crazy woman.,"""I'll never be better"", ""I'll always be a crazy woman""","The speaker is predicting an absolute and unchanging future state, indicating certainty that things will never improve. This is a clear example of assuming an inevitable negative outcome without evidence. The statement extends this belief to a global, permanent condition about themselves.",Fortune-telling

They're the ones who despise people because they're in good shape!,"'How do those skinny guys set me up to laugh at me?', 'They're the ones who despise people because they're in good shape!'","The statement attributes negative intentions ('set me up to laugh at me') to others without concrete evidence, indicating an assumption about their thoughts or feelings. Additionally, it generalizes that they 'despise people' solely based on their good shape, which is an overgeneralization about a whole group. The key cognitive distortion here is 'Mind Reading,' as the speaker presumes to know what others are thinking (they want to laugh at him/her) without explicit proof.",Mind Reading

Why do you have to hurry?","""If I hadn't been too anxious, I wouldn't have forgotten to save it."", ""It's my fault."", ""Why do you have to hurry?""","The statement places full blame on the speaker's anxiety for forgetting to save the work, implying a direct cause-effect relation without considering other factors (e.g., technical issues, distractions). The phrase ""It's my fault"" shows the speaker taking personal responsibility, suggesting an internal attribution for the negative event. Additionally, there is an implicit criticism toward the rushing, which could be seen as externalizing some blame. The key element is the assumption that the speaker's anxiety alone caused the problem, characteristic of Personalization, where one takes excessive responsibility for negative outcomes, disregarding other plausible causes or external factors.",Personalization
2897,It's always been my problem to try to reach them.,"""It's always been my problem""","The phrase ""always"" indicates a sweeping generalization about the situation, implying that the problem has existed at all times.

This indicates the person is taking personal responsibility for events likely beyond their control (parents passing away) and attributing it to their own inadequacy. This aligns with Personalization, where the individual interprets external events as being directly their fault or responsibility.",Personalization
2899,I can't even remember her birthday. Her girlfriends must be trying to convince her to break up with me.,"""I can't even remember her birthday."" and ""Her girlfriends must be trying to convince her to break up with me.""","The first key phrase suggests a fact about forgetfulness, but the critical distortion lies in the second phrase where the speaker assumes they know what others are thinking and what their intentions are without any evidence. This is an example of Mind Reading, as the speaker is attributing thoughts and motives to others without confirmation.",Mind Reading
2900,I don't want to go to the next few places. I don't want me.,"""I don't want to go to the next few places.""; ""I don't want me.""","The first phrase expresses an unwillingness or avoidance of future situations, which might suggest negative forecasting, but does not explicitly predict an outcome (so less likely Fortune-telling). The second phrase, ""I don't want me,"" reflects a strong negative self-assessment or self-labeling, indicating a negative global label applied to the self. It is not an overgeneralization or all-or-nothing about external events but a labeling cognitive distortion where the individual assigns a negative label to themselves. Thus, the main distortion here is 'Labeling'.",Labeling

This is a waste!,"""I'm sick of it!"", ""I was gonna cook a hot pot in my bedroom!"", ""This is a waste!""","The speaker expresses strong frustration ('I'm sick of it!') indicating an emotional response. They focus exclusively on the negative aspect that their plan to cook a hot pot in the bedroom was ruined or wasted, disregarding any neutral or positive perspectives. The phrase 'This is a waste!' suggests a magnified view of the situation as completely negative and pointless. This represents magnification, where the negative aspects of the event are exaggerated.",Magnification

He doesn't care how we feel!,"""The dean just wants to make us suffer"", ""He doesn't care how we feel""","The statement assumes the dean's intentions and thoughts without direct evidence, attributing a negative motive to him ('just wants to make us suffer'). This reflects an assumption about the dean's internal state and feelings ('doesn't care how we feel'), which aligns with attempting to read someone else's mind rather than knowing the facts. Therefore, the distortion is related to assuming one knows what another person is thinking without confirmation.",Mind Reading

Self-culpatory feelings haunt me as if everything was wrong from me.","Bad words, reckless actions, always unwittingly harm those around me. Self-culpatory feelings haunt me as if everything was wrong from me.","The statement includes the phrase 'always unwittingly harm those around me,' indicating a pattern where the person believes they are consistently causing harm. This suggests a generalization from specific incidents to a universal belief. Additionally, the feeling that 'everything was wrong from me' implies taking excessive blame for various negative outcomes. Such a pattern aligns with overgeneralization, where one perceives a single or few negative events as ongoing and all-encompassing. Although there is some self-blame (personalization), the key cognitive distortion is the broad conclusion drawn from events, i.e., overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

There is no evidence of thinking based solely on emotions as facts (emotional reasoning) or assuming others' thoughts (mind reading). The speaker is simply acknowledging the loss and the significance of the dog being gone, which is a factual statement about the situation without distorted thinking. Therefore, the statement does not display a cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

He must have been after me.,"""I'm the only one who's too busy to die."" and ""He must have been after me.""","The phrase ""I'm the only one who's too busy to die"" implies an exaggeration of the speaker's situation compared to others, which suggests a sense of uniqueness and isolation. The phrase ""He must have been after me"" indicates the speaker is assuming the intentions of another person without evidence, essentially guessing their motives. This reflects the cognitive distortion of assuming to know what others are thinking, which fits the distortion labeled 'Mind Reading'. Although there is a hint of exaggeration, the dominant distortion is concluding others' mental states without proof.",Mind Reading
2909,"He beat me so hard, it seems he usually hates me.","""He beat me so hard"", ""it seems he usually hates me""","The statement moves from a specific event (being beaten hard) to a general conclusion about the other person's feelings (usually hates me).

2910,You'll be late. It's a minor lesson.,"""You'll be late"", ""It's a minor lesson""","The phrase ""You'll be late"" predicts a future event without evidence, assuming lateness will definitely occur. This reflects the distortion of predicting an outcome negatively without certainty. The second phrase, ""It's a minor lesson,"" attempts to minimize the perceived importance of the situation but does not change the nature of the initial prediction. Since the main cognitive distortion relates to predicting a negative event with certainty, this aligns best with 'Fortune-telling'.",Fortune-telling

""My friends will think I'm parked in the middle like a fool.""","The statement ""I can't swim anymore"" reflects a negative self-assessment, but it is followed by a prediction about what others will think: ""My friends will think I'm parked in the middle like a fool."" This shows the speaker assuming they know what their friends will think without any evidence, which fits the definition of Mind Reading. The speaker is making a negative inference about others' thoughts rather than focusing on their own feelings or facts.",Mind Reading

It's gotta be a stupid guy.,"""I'm so stupid"", ""I can't even do a little thing like booking a hotel"", ""It's gotta be a stupid guy""","The speaker uses a negative label ""stupid"" to describe themselves globally based on a specific failure (booking a hotel). This is not about black-and-white thinking or predicting the future, but rather assigning a fixed negative identity to themselves. The statement applies a negative trait to their entire self, which fits the pattern of labeling. This differs from overgeneralization because it is about categorizing the self, not making a broad conclusion from one event.",Labeling
2913,I must be dying. I'm depressed. I've got suicide thoughts.,"""I must be dying"", ""I'm depressed"", ""I've got suicide thoughts""","The statement 'I must be dying' reflects a conclusion drawn from an emotional state rather than objective evidence. The speaker equates feeling depressed and having suicidal thoughts with the certainty of dying. This indicates they are using their feelings and internal state as proof of reality, which is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing extremes, generalizations, or other distortions listed. The statement is driven by interpreting emotional experiences as factual truth.",Emotional Reasoning

That's what's embarrassing me.,'That's what he thinks I hate.' and 'That's what's embarrassing me.',"The speaker infers what 'he thinks' without any explicit evidence, assuming to know another person's thoughts. This reflects 'Mind Reading' because the individual believes they can interpret the other person's inner thoughts directly. Additionally, the statement expresses an emotional reaction ('that's embarrassing me'), but the primary distortion is the assumption about someone else's thoughts rather than purely reasoning from emotion or prediction.",Mind Reading

This implies that the speaker is taking the behavior or characteristics observed in some parents and applying it universally. Such generalizing from specific instances to all members of a group aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2916,"Poor economics, I'm sure I'm weak, narrow-sighted, bad character, and no one else.","I'm sure I'm weak, narrow-sighted, bad character, and no one else.","The statement involves assigning a broad negative label to oneself based on perceived faults or behavior, such as 'weak,' 'narrow-sighted,' and 'bad character.' This is a classic example of labeling, where a person defines themselves in a negative and global way instead of focusing on specific behaviors or situations. The sentence is not about predicting the future (fortune-telling), nor about all-or-nothing extremes, nor just magnifying or emotional reasoning. It is clearly attributing a negative label to the self.",Labeling

Am I a white-eyed wolf?","""It's hard for me to be sad about something like that"", ""why can't I cry?"", ""Am I a white-eyed wolf?""","The speaker is questioning why they are unable to cry in a situation that might normally evoke sadness. They express confusion about their emotional reaction and use the term 'white-eyed wolf' as a label for themselves, which suggests a negative self-judgment or identity based on this inability. This aligns with the cognitive distortion known as 'Labeling,' where a person assigns a global, often negative, label to themselves based on a specific behavior or feeling.",Labeling
2918,She's working when I'm working. She's working when I'm off.,"""She's working when I'm working. She's working when I'm off.""","The statement repeats the condition that 'she's working' regardless of the speaker's own working status, implying a blanket generalization across multiple situations without exception. This reflects an overgeneralization, as the speaker is concluding a pattern based on the repetition without nuance or exception. It is not all-or-nothing because it does not present an absolute success/failure dichotomy, nor is it emotional reasoning, mind reading, or any other distortion listed.",Overgeneralization
2919,I feel like I'm a liability in the lab.,"""I feel like I'm a liability in the lab.""","The phrase ""I feel like I'm a liability"" indicates that the person is basing their judgment on their emotional state rather than objective evidence.

2920,"Even if I try to fit in, they'll never like me.","Even if I try to fit in, they'll never like me.","The statement assumes a negative outcome ('they'll never like me') despite efforts ('Even if I try to fit in'). This involves predicting a future event negatively without sufficient evidence, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling'. It is not 'Mind Reading' because it doesn't claim to know others' thoughts, but rather predicts an unfavorable outcome. It is not 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' because it is not framing the situation in extreme terms about the self's traits or actions but about a predicted social outcome. The negative expectation about a future event based on no certain evidence is indicative of 'Fortune-telling'.",Fortune-telling

This reflects assuming what the other person is thinking or feeling without direct knowledge. The labeling of the person as ""so hypocritical"" is also present, but the dominant distortion appears to be assuming the other's internal state (jealousy, intent to hinder). Therefore, the key cognitive distortion here is Mind Reading.",Mind Reading
2924,It's bad luck to find a room like this.,"""It's bad luck to find a room like this.""","The statement predicts an outcome based on an assumption about luck without evidence; it assumes a negative future event (bad luck) will occur because of the current situation (finding a room like this).

Next time I see a case like this, I'll probably know how to handle it.","The speaker acknowledges the difficulty of the current case, describing it as a long experience, which reflects an understanding that the challenge is present now. However, the speaker then expresses optimism that in the future, with similar cases, they will be better equipped to manage them. This shows a hopeful and realistic perspective rather than an exaggerated, distorted, or irrational belief. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, labeling, or other distortions. The statement does not generalize beyond the current case, nor does it assign blame or make unwarranted predictions. Instead, it reflects a learning process and growth mindset, which is healthy and corresponds to 'No Distortion'.",No Distortion

However, the last part ""The teacher said I should do it too"" contains a statement of what 'should' have been done, indicating the use of a 'should statement' cognitive distortion, where unrealistic or rigid rules and expectations are imposed on oneself based on others' demands. The dominant distortion here involves the rigid use of 'should' from an external authority (the teacher).",Should statements

This reflects an extreme viewpoint without acknowledging any positive aspects or exceptions, which fits the pattern of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
2928,I've been doing this lately because I deserve it.,"""I deserve it""","The key phrase ""I deserve it"" implies that the action is justified solely based on a feeling of deservingness. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where someone concludes something is true because they feel it strongly, rather than based on objective evidence. The statement does not show all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, magnification, mental filter, mind reading, overgeneralization, personalization, or should statements. It centers on using an emotion or belief ('deserve') as the reason for behavior.",Emotional Reasoning

The phrase ""It's not like I almost got close to the hospital last time"" minimizes or downplays the severity of the current situation by comparing it to a more severe past event. This suggests a selective focus on a positive aspect to reduce anxiety. This is not predicting the future (fortune-telling), nor assigning labels or making absolute judgments. It appears the person is filtering information to emphasize positive outlook amidst discomfort, consistent with a Mental filter distortion, where the individual filters out negative information to focus on something slightly positive to cope.",Mental filter

This reflects a form of overgeneralization where one or a few negative events are interpreted as an eternal pattern that affects all aspects of life. There is no indication of absolutes typical of All-or-Nothing Thinking (e.g., things are either perfect or a total failure), nor does the statement reflect emotions as evidence (Emotional Reasoning), fortune-telling (predicting the future), or labeling of the self with a negative word.

The phrase ""There's no end to this trouble"" suggests a prediction of a negative future outcome without certainty, fitting the definition of fortune-telling. However, since the task requires choosing one distortion, the statement primarily reflects a negative prediction about the future (ongoing trouble with no end), which is best defined as fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
2932,"I don't know how to solve a conflict. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.","""I don't know how to solve a conflict""; ""Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.""","The statement expresses a belief that the speaker is completely incapable of solving conflict, both in terms of knowledge and ability, implying a fixed inability regardless of effort or circumstance. This reflects a rigid, absolute way of thinking without considering potential growth or alternative outcomes. This kind of thinking aligns with 'All-or-Nothing Thinking,' where situations are seen in extremes, such as 'I can't solve conflicts at all,' rather than recognizing degrees of skill or potential improvement.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

2935,I very much hope that I am straight and that my sexual orientation has dragged my family and troubled them.,hope that I am straight; my sexual orientation has dragged my family and troubled them,"The statement expresses a hope about being straight, indicating uncertainty about sexual orientation. The phrase 'has dragged my family and troubled them' implies a belief that their sexual orientation is causing distress to family members. This suggests the individual is assuming responsibility for their family's feelings and troubles without explicit evidence. This reflects personalization, where one believes they are the cause of others' negative emotions or experiences.",Personalization
2936,Why can't the sky stop raining so I can get my test going? Now I'm going to fail.,"""Now I'm going to fail.""","The phrase ""Now I'm going to fail"" reflects a prediction made without concrete evidence; the speaker assumes a negative outcome (failing the test) based on current circumstances (rain delaying the test). This is a classic example of 'fortune-telling,' where one predicts future events with certainty in a negative way. Other distortions like magnification or all-or-nothing thinking don't fit as well because the focus is on predicting a specific negative future event rather than exaggerating or categorizing. Emotional reasoning is not dominant since the statement is a prediction, not an inference based on feelings alone.",Fortune-telling

I'm so bad.,"The phrase 'I can't take this responsibility anymore' shows a sense of overwhelm but is not a distortion by itself. 'I always think about it' implies excessive rumination but does not directly indicate a cognitive distortion from the list. The key phrase 'I'm so bad' is a negative global self-judgment, which fits the definition of Labeling, as the person is attaching a negative label to themselves instead of evaluating a specific behavior or situation. Other elements like 'Dogs jump in the room' seem irrelevant or do not contribute to a cognitive distortion classification. Therefore, the dominant distortion here is Labeling.",Labeling

2940,I like to stay at home. It's nice not to go out.,I like to stay at home. It's nice not to go out.,"The statement expresses a personal preference and a positive feeling about staying at home rather than going out. There is no evidence of distorted thinking such as exaggeration, negative labeling, rigid thinking, assumptions about the future or others' thoughts, or self-blame. The statement is a neutral/positive self-expression without cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

This goes beyond describing specific behaviors or moments and instead assigns a negative label to the whole person. These are classic indicators of the 'Labeling' cognitive distortion, where a single characteristic or behavior is used to define one's entire self.",Labeling
2942,"While many dreams remain unfulfilled, and even though my family still needs my company, I must live my life.","many dreams remain unfulfilled, my family still needs my company, I must live my life","The statement acknowledges that some dreams are unfulfilled and that the family needs company, but concludes with a determination to live life despite these facts. There is no absolutist or polarized thinking (ruling out All-or-Nothing), no assumption about future events (ruling out Fortune-telling), no emotional justification without evidence (ruling out Emotional Reasoning), no assigning of blame or personal targeting (ruling out Personalization), no extreme generalization from limited facts (ruling out Overgeneralization), no filtering or ignoring of positives (ruling out Mental Filter). The phrase 'I must live my life' aligns with acceptance given constraints rather than demanding 'should' or 'must' that typically cause distress.

Specifically, they predict their roommate will think negatively of them and their boyfriend will hate them. This involves attributing thoughts and feelings to others automatically, which characterizes mind reading.

This aligns with 'Should statements,' where the person uses strict and often unrealistic expectations about how others should behave.",Should statements
2945,"I'm so stupid, even if I'm involved in a variety of activities, my teammates will hate me for stalling.","""I'm so stupid"", ""my teammates will hate me for stalling""","The phrase ""I'm so stupid"" clearly categorizes the speaker in a negative and global way, indicating they are labeling themselves with a harsh, negative identity rather than focusing on a specific behavior or event. The belief that ""my teammates will hate me for stalling"" shows an assumption about others' thoughts without concrete evidence, which aligns with mind reading. However, the strongest distortion present is the negative self-judgment ""I'm so stupid"", which is a classic example of Labeling—assigning a negative label to oneself. The other parts, while relevant, are secondary to the clear use of labeling in the first phrase.",Labeling

It's normal not to make friends with me.""","The statement involves the speaker predicting a future social outcome ('It's normal not to make friends with me'), which reflects an assumption about what will happen. Additionally, the speaker expresses a belief that they alone remain isolated, which goes beyond the current reality and assumes a continuing negative social situation. These indicate the distortion of 'Fortune-telling,' where the person jumps to conclusions about the future in a negative way without evidence.",Fortune-telling

2948,"I caught a cold, probably with a weak resistance.","""I caught a cold, probably with a weak resistance.""","The speaker attributes catching a cold to having ""probably a weak resistance,"" which involves making an assumption about their own health state based on the occurrence of the cold. This reflects a form of 'fortune-telling'—predicting or assuming a cause or future condition without conclusive evidence. The use of 'probably' indicates an assumed cause rather than a confirmed fact. The thought does not show an extreme either-or view (not All-or-Nothing), does not involve emotional justification (not Emotional Reasoning), is not an overgeneralization or labeling, nor is it reading others' minds or filtering selectively. Therefore, 'Fortune-telling' is the closest fit.",Fortune-telling

""If the world were to die, I wouldn't have to work.""","The statement expresses a desire for an extreme, catastrophic event (the world ending) as a means to avoid an undesirable task (working). The person assumes that if the world ends, they will no longer have to work, which is a type of predicting a future event with certainty.

This assumption about others' thoughts represents mind reading, where the person presumes to know what others think. The decision to avoid care is based on this assumed negative judgment, reflecting the 'Mind Reading' distortion rather than other distortions like Fortune-telling (predicting future outcomes without certainty) or Emotional Reasoning (assuming negative feelings imply reality).",Mind Reading

It also assumes others' perceptions without evidence ('not even my children look down on me'), implying a negative interpretation of their feelings. The key cognitive distortion is labeling, as the speaker assigns negative, global labels to themselves without nuance, rather than just describing behaviors or situations.",Labeling
2954,They are understanding friends. They will understand me.,"""They are understanding friends""; ""They will understand me.""","The statement assumes that the friends will understand the speaker without evidence or confirmation, projecting a certain outcome in the future.

2957,"I've been working so hard for so long, I haven't saved any money. It's a piece of shit.",I haven't saved any money. It's a piece of shit.,"The speaker focuses only on the negative outcome of not saving money and uses a harsh, global negative label ('a piece of shit') to describe the situation or possibly themselves. This reflects a form of labeling where a negative trait or outcome is generalized into an all-encompassing negative term. There is no indication of all-or-nothing (complete success or failure), emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, or other distortions. The key distortion is applying a negative label to the situation/person based on one aspect.",Labeling

The phrase ""I must be the dumbest person in the world"" is an extreme negative label applied to themselves. This indicates the use of a broad generalization from specific instances of forgetfulness or error to an all-encompassing negative self-assessment. These patterns align strongly with Overgeneralization where one concludes a global negative about oneself from specific perceived failures or flaws. It does not fit All-or-Nothing Thinking fully because that requires strict dichotomous thinking, and it's more about applying a negative label rather than just black-and-white thinking. The emphasis on labeling oneself negatively also suggests Labeling, but here the primary mechanism is overgeneralizing failures to global incompetence. Thus, the best fitting single distortion is Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

This reflects a tendency to focus on negative aspects, potentially ignoring any positive or neutral experiences. The expression 'hasn't been written for so long' also conveys a sense that a certain action hasn't occurred recently, which can be taken as a broad negative conclusion.

The second part, ""Why don't you just give up and die in bed?"" implies an assumption about the other person's feelings or thoughts (that they should give up), suggesting a negative prediction about the future or others' internal states. This reflects an assumption about how things will turn out or what another person is thinking without evidence.

This expresses a sense of requirement or duty, aligning with the concept of 'Should statements,' where the person feels they must act in a certain way.

However, the follow-up ""There's still a chance to fix it"" contradicts a purely black-and-white view, showing some recognition of potential improvement. Since ""This can't go on anymore"" implies a sense of hopelessness or an extreme limit, it could lean toward All-or-Nothing Thinking, which is characterized by seeing situations in absolute, either-or terms. The acknowledging of a chance to fix it, however, suggests a break from pure All-or-Nothing Thinking, potentially reducing the distortion's intensity. Despite this, the main emphasis is on the absolute limit indicated by ""This can't go on anymore."" None of the other provided distortions fit as well because: - It's not Emotional Reasoning as no feelings are used as evidence. - It’s not Fortune-telling as no prediction about future events is made. - It's not Labeling as there are no global judgments about self or others. - It’s not Magnification or Mental filter as the statement does not amplify negatives or filter positives. - It’s not Mind Reading or Personalization due to lack of assumptions about others' thoughts or taking blame. - It’s not Overgeneralization because it does not generalize from one event to many. - It’s not Should statements since there are no prescriptive statements about how things must be.

""I'm nothing"" is a broad, global statement labeling the self as worthless or without value. This is not just a single negative event but a personal and global label placed on oneself. This aligns closely with the cognitive distortion of 'Labeling', where a person assigns a fixed negative label to themselves based on perceived failures or shortcomings. The other statements don't reflect all-or-nothing thinking (extremes with no middle ground), fortune-telling (predicting the future negatively), or personalization (assuming excessive responsibility).

It reflects optimism rather than a cognitive distortion. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, labeling, or any negative predictive bias. Therefore, it does not fit the typical cognitive distortions listed.",No Distortion
2992,Standing with someone who looks good makes me ashamed.,Standing with someone who looks good makes me ashamed,"The statement involves attributing a personal feeling (shame) directly to being in proximity with someone who looks good. This suggests that the speaker is interpreting an external situation as proof of their own negative trait or feeling (shame), despite no explicit evidence that the other person's appearance should cause shame. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the person believes that their emotion (ashamed) reflects an undeniable truth about the situation. It is not about predicting the future (Fortune-telling), labeling a person, or using absolutes (All-or-Nothing).

2995,"I saw my colleague with my water bottle the day before yesterday. He drugged me, didn't he?","I saw my colleague with my water bottle the day before yesterday. He drugged me, didn't he?","The statement includes an assumption about the colleague's intentions and actions without direct evidence. The speaker infers negatively what the colleague might have done based solely on seeing him with the water bottle, which indicates a prediction about the future or assumption about an event without proof. This fits the pattern of 'Fortune-telling,' where the person assumes something bad has occurred or will occur despite lacking concrete evidence.",Fortune-telling
2996,"He stood me up because I wasn't ready to work, right?","""He stood me up"" and ""because I wasn't ready to work""","The statement assumes a specific reason for someone else's behavior without evidence. The speaker infers the other person's motive (standing them up) based on their own readiness, which aligns with assuming to know the thoughts or intentions of another person. This pattern is consistent with 'Mind Reading' cognitive distortion, where one believes they know what others are thinking or feeling without confirmation.",Mind Reading
2997,"I'd rather die than die, so it won't hurt.","""I'd rather die than die, so it won't hurt.""","The statement presents a paradoxical preference that implies an extreme, black-or-white thinking pattern. The speaker suggests a choice between the same outcome (dying) but with a twisted logic that involves the experience of pain or lack thereof. This reflects an either-or approach where only two absolute and opposite possibilities exist, without acknowledging any middle ground or alternative options. This type of cognitive distortion aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking, which involves seeing situations in extremes.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
2998,"My main feeling is nothing, not grief, but I think I need to feel a lot of grief to overcome the difficulties, but I cannot let myself experience them.","My main feeling is nothing, not grief, but I think I need to feel a lot of grief to overcome the difficulties, but I cannot let myself experience them.","The statement suggests the person believes they must feel a significant amount of grief to work through their difficulties, implying a rigid rule or belief about how one 'should' feel to overcome challenges. The phrase 'I think I need to feel a lot of grief' signals there is an internal expectation about what emotions are necessary. This aligns with the 'Should statements' distortion, where someone imposes strict rules or expectations on themselves regarding emotions or behaviors. The statement does not reflect all-or-nothing thinking, magnification, or other distortions as clearly as it reflects a 'should' belief about emotional experience.",Should statements
2999,It must have been a lot of credit for me.,"""It must have been a lot of credit for me.""","The phrase ""It must have been"" indicates a conclusion or assumption being made without concrete evidence, projecting a certain outcome or fact. This aligns with predicting or assuming something about the future or a situation without certainty, which is characteristic of Fortune-telling. The statement infers a particular interpretation about the amount of credit received, without clear verification.",Fortune-telling
3000,There's nothing to worry about. The clothes aren't obvious. No one must have noticed.,"""No one must have noticed""","The speaker assumes they know what others are thinking or perceiving without any concrete evidence. They are projecting thoughts or judgments onto others, believing that no one has noticed the clothes when this cannot be verified.

3001,"I haven't tried to get there yet. After all, there are so many good people.","""I haven't tried to get there yet."" and ""After all, there are so many good people.""","The statement acknowledges the speaker has not yet attempted to achieve a goal or reach a particular point ('I haven't tried to get there yet'). The follow-up phrase 'After all, there are so many good people' implies the speaker is using the presence of others (good people) as a reason for not trying or feeling less urgency. This suggests the speaker is making a prediction about future events or outcomes without sufficient evidence, assuming that because there are many good people, their own effort might not be needed or impactful. This fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts negative or uncertain outcomes without enough evidence. The statement does not exhibit the other distortions explicitly.",Fortune-telling
3002,"Because of last night ' s fascination of film, I now have to face the price of sleeplessness, and I cannot rest in my heart.","Because of last night ' s fascination of film, I now have to face the price of sleeplessness, and I cannot rest in my heart.","The statement links the emotional state of sleeplessness and heart unrest directly to the previous night's film fascination, implying the emotion or physical state is an undeniable fact solely caused by that event. This reflects the pattern of emotional reasoning, where the individual believes their emotional experience (sleeplessness and heart unrest) is proof of an objective reality (the 'price' they must pay), without neutral or alternative explanations. There is no indication of exaggeration (magnification), a rigid dichotomy (all-or-nothing), predictions about the future (fortune-telling), or assigning global labels. Therefore, the cognitive distortion best fitting this statement is Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

I'm screwed if I don't get rid of her.,"""She ruined my life in college for four years"", ""There's nothing good about it"", ""I'm screwed if I don't get rid of her""","The statement involves broad negative conclusions applied to a long time span ('ruined my life in college for four years'), suggesting a sweeping negative judgment covering an extended period. The phrase 'There's nothing good about it' indicates an extreme black-and-white, absolute perspective. Additionally, 'I'm screwed if I don't get rid of her' predicts a negative outcome with certainty. Among these, the most prominent distortion is the broad negative conclusion that one single event or person has utterly ruined the entire college experience, which aligns strongly with Overgeneralization, where one or two negative events are seen as a never-ending pattern of defeat or ruin.",Overgeneralization
3004,She's a big winner. I envy her for working with energy and passion all day long.,"""She's a big winner"", ""I envy her for working with energy and passion all day long.""","The speaker calls her ""a big winner,"" which is a global label applied to her based on single or limited observed behaviors (working with energy and passion all day). This represents labeling—a cognitive distortion where an extreme, generalized label is assigned to a person rather than describing specific behaviors. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking (no extremes like always or never), no emotional reasoning (the statement is not based solely on feelings), no fortune-telling (no predictions), no magnification (no exaggeration of negatives), no mental filter (no focusing only on negatives), no mind reading (no assuming others' thoughts), no overgeneralization (beyond normal breadth), no personalization (no blaming self), and no should statements (no moral imperatives). Therefore, the primary distortion is labeling.",Labeling

This reflects predicting a future event based on current fears without evidence. The key phrase ""people are going to laugh at me"" indicates assuming knowledge of future social judgment. Thus, the cognitive distortion involves making a negative prediction about the future without certainty, which matches the definition of Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
3007,"Shouldn't I leave and make him answer the phone, or be afraid to delay him?","""Shouldn't I leave"", ""make him answer the phone"", ""be afraid to delay him""","The statement includes the word ""Shouldn't,"" which indicates the presence of a ""Should statement"" distortion. The speaker is imposing a rule or expectation on themselves about what they ought to do (leave and make him answer the phone, or be afraid of delay). This type of thought reflects rigid rules about how one should behave or how situations should unfold, which is the hallmark of the ""Should statements"" cognitive distortion.",Should statements
3008,It's my fault I couldn't handle it well in advance.,"""It's my fault""","The statement blames oneself entirely for not handling the situation well in advance. This reflects an exaggerated self-blame where the individual attributes the responsibility solely to themselves, even though other factors may have contributed. This is characteristic of Personalization, which involves taking excessive responsibility for negative events.",Personalization

Additionally, the statement ""I'm definitely the worst student in the teacher's mind"" involves assuming the teacher's thoughts and feelings towards them without confirmation (mind reading). However, since one label must be chosen, the dominant distortion here is the prediction of future negative events ('I'll get scolded') leading to their response ('I'll skip school'), which aligns closely with Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
3010,"He's bound to spread my bad words behind my back, and then everybody's gonna get away from me.","He's bound to spread my bad words behind my back, and then everybody's gonna get away from me.","The statement assumes with certainty that 'he' will spread bad words and that 'everybody' will consequently avoid the speaker. This reflects predicting a negative future outcome without evidence, relying on an assumption about others' behavior and the subsequent effects. This fits the distortion of 'Fortune-telling,' which involves making negative predictions about what will happen.",Fortune-telling

The person believes passers-by are thinking negatively about them ('scolding me for being a psychopath'), which is an example of trying to read others' minds. This inference is not based on observable facts but on the individual's assumption of others' thoughts and judgments.",Mind Reading
3013,I'm so useless. I'm so sick.,"""I'm so useless"", ""I'm so sick""","The phrase ""I'm so useless"" is a broad, negative label applied to the self, indicating a global and fixed characterization rather than a specific behavior or event. This matches the cognitive distortion type of Labeling, which involves assigning a negative and absolute label to oneself or others. The phrase ""I'm so sick"" may be a physical state description but does not contradict or alter the labeling aspect here.",Labeling
3014,"I've worked so hard every day to carry out the task entrusted to me by my leadership, and I've been criticized and hard to do.","'I've worked so hard every day', 'criticized', 'hard to do'","The statement highlights the speaker's effort ('worked hard every day') contrasted with the experience of criticism. The phrase 'I've been criticized and hard to do' suggests a perception that despite their effort, the task remains difficult and they are negatively evaluated. This reflects an emotional response to the criticism, interpreting the situation as inherently negative based on feelings rather than objective evidence. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings dictate the interpretation of reality.",Emotional Reasoning
3015,The dog must have put it here deliberately to get back at me. He wanted to rob me of my job.,"""The dog must have put it here deliberately to get back at me.""; ""He wanted to rob me of my job.""","The statement assumes the dog's intentional desire to cause harm or revenge, attributing specific malicious intentions without evidence. This reflects the process of interpreting another's motives directly and negatively without confirmation. The key distortion is the assumption of knowing what the dog 'must' have intended, which fits classic mind reading—believing you know someone else's thoughts or intentions. It is not personalizing in the typical sense because the dog is not human, but the core issue is assuming malicious intent (mind reading).",Mind Reading
3016,Have I been working too hard lately to make him nervous?,Have I been working too hard lately to make him nervous?,"The statement assumes the speaker knows what the other person is feeling (nervous) without direct evidence. This involves attributing thoughts or feelings to someone else based on the speaker's own perception or interpretation. This matches the definition of 'Mind Reading,' where a person believes they know what others are thinking or feeling without confirmation.",Mind Reading
3017,"I've been through a lot of nightly work, and he's just taken my credit and my colleagues are such disgusting people.",he's just taken my credit; my colleagues are such disgusting people,"The phrase 'he's just taken my credit' suggests a perception of intentional wrongdoing directed personally, while 'my colleagues are such disgusting people' applies a highly negative label to an entire group based on perceived behavior. Labeling involves assigning a fixed, often negative, identity to oneself or others based on limited evidence or specific behaviors. Here, the speaker is generalizing negative traits ('disgusting') to all colleagues instead of the specific action or person. Although there is an element of personalization in feeling wronged, the dominant distortion is labeling the colleagues negatively.",Labeling
3018,The fact that each person has his or her own strengths and weaknesses cannot be changed in a short period of time.,each person has his or her own strengths and weaknesses; cannot be changed in a short period of time,"The statement acknowledges a universal truth that everyone has strengths and weaknesses. The key part is the claim that this fact 'cannot be changed in a short period of time.' This indicates a belief that change is impossible or unrealistic within a certain timeframe, but it does not imply an absolute or black-and-white thinking (all-or-nothing), a negative overgeneralization about oneself or others, or emotional reasoning. Instead, it accepts a realistic limitation about the pace of change. There is no indication of fortune-telling (predicting the future negatively), labeling, personalization, mind reading, magnification, or use of 'should' statements. Therefore, this statement reflects a realistic observation rather than a cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

Marriage is a grave!,"""I don't have any feelings for him."", ""I'm just disappointed."", ""Marriage is a grave!""","The statement 'Marriage is a grave!' indicates a very extreme and negative view of marriage, suggesting that it is completely bad or dead, without middle ground. This reflects a kind of black-and-white thinking. The phrase 'I don't have any feelings for him' and 'I'm just disappointed' shows emotional reasoning to some extent, but the dominant distortion is the sweeping negative judgment about marriage in general. This exaggerates one negative feeling to represent all of marriage as hopeless or terrible, which aligns best with All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3020,My body was warning me that I had to go to the hospital for a check-up this weekend.,"""My body was warning me""; ""I had to go to the hospital for a check-up this weekend.""","The phrase 'My body was warning me' suggests the speaker is interpreting their physical sensations as a direct signal or proof that something must be done (going to the hospital). This reflects relying on feelings or bodily sensations as evidence for a fact, rather than objective evidence. The statement assumes that the bodily sensation is an indicator of an urgent need, which fits the pattern of Emotional Reasoning — believing that an emotional or physical sensation reflects reality without further evidence.",Emotional Reasoning
3021,I can't sleep. What else can I do?,"""I can't sleep"", ""What else can I do?""","The statement ""I can't sleep"" suggests a current fact or experience of difficulty sleeping. The immediate follow-up question, ""What else can I do?"", implies a belief that there are no other options or solutions available. This reflects a negative prediction about the future and a sense of helplessness without identifying specific alternatives. This type of thinking aligns with Fortune-telling, where one assumes or predicts a negative outcome without evidence.",Fortune-telling
3022,The leadership must be so disappointed in me that I will no longer be left with an important task.,The leadership must be so disappointed in me; I will no longer be left with an important task.,"The statement assumes the thoughts and feelings of the leadership without concrete evidence ('The leadership must be so disappointed in me'), which indicates the person is 'reading minds'. It also predicts a negative future outcome ('I will no longer be left with an important task') based on that assumption. However, the core distortion is the belief about what others think without validation, fitting the definition of Mind Reading more than Fortune-telling (which involves predicting the future about events rather than others' thoughts).",Mind Reading
3023,"Oh, that's a lot of money. It hurts.","""Oh, that's a lot of money. It hurts.""","The statement focuses on the amount of money and the accompanying emotional pain, implying that because the sum is large, it inevitably causes pain. This reflects a process where feelings (hurt) are taken as evidence of reality (the money amount being painful), demonstrating emotional reasoning. The person is concluding that the situation is bad purely based on their emotional response rather than objective facts.",Emotional Reasoning
3024,These people don't look friendly at all. I'm still not going to know them. I can do it alone.,"""These people don't look friendly at all."" ""I'm still not going to know them.""","The speaker assumes that because these people do not appear friendly, they will not get to know them. This is a prediction without evidence and is based on interpreting others' appearance or demeanor.

Does anyone else think that I'm bad at it?,"The speaker is assuming that others share the same negative belief about their abilities without any evidence. This reflects an attempt to read others' thoughts or feelings, which is characteristic of mind reading. There is no indication of predicting the future (fortune-telling) or categorizing oneself in extremes (all-or-nothing). The key point is the assumption about others' thoughts.",Mind Reading

They deserve to die.,"""Why would a teacher find me?"", ""The other classmates told me."", ""They deserve to die.""","The individual is assuming negative intent or outcome without evidence, as in ""Why would a teacher find me?"" which implies expecting a negative consequence. This reflects predicting a negative future event without certainty, characteristic of Fortune-telling. The statement ""They deserve to die"" is a harsh judgment but does not itself fall under a distortion listed; rather, the key cognitive distortion is the negative prediction about being targeted. Therefore, the primary distortion here is Fortune-telling, where the person predicts an unpleasant outcome without sufficient proof.",Fortune-telling
3028,What kind of restaurant? We'll close up sooner or later.,"""We'll close up sooner or later.""","The statement predicts a negative future event (the restaurant closing) with certainty and inevitability, without evidence.

The person holds on to one specific comforting fantasy about seeing the person again in the next life, despite the negativity surrounding it. This selective attention to negative elements and dismissal of other perspectives aligns with focusing excessively on a single negative aspect, which is characteristic of the 'Mental filter' distortion.",Mental filter
3030,My parents turned a blind eye to me because I did not do what I could and I was never able to satisfy them.,My parents turned a blind eye to me; I did not do what I could; I was never able to satisfy them.,"The statement implies that the parents' behavior (turning a blind eye) is solely due to the speaker's failure to do their best and satisfy them. This is assigning full responsibility to oneself for others' reactions, which reflects taking personal blame beyond one's control. The phrase 'I was never able to satisfy them' exaggerates the situation to a complete failure, but the primary distortion is attributing the parents' behavior directly and personally to the speaker's actions. This best matches 'Personalization', where one believes that external events or others' behaviors are directly caused by oneself.",Personalization
3031,Isn't this guy jealous of me because I'm a good learner?,"""Isn't this guy jealous of me because I'm a good learner?""","The statement assumes the internal state (jealousy) of another person without evidence.

I'm sorry to lie, and I'm sorry to let you see it.","The speaker labels themselves negatively by saying 'I look disgusting,' which assigns a global, negative label to themselves based on their appearance. Additionally, saying 'I'm sorry to lie' implies assuming negative intent or fault without evidence, but the primary distortion here is the global negative self-label. Thus, the statement fits best with the cognitive distortion of labeling, where one assigns a fixed, negative label to oneself.",Labeling

This reflects a belief that others' thoughts or intentions (not telling them to go out) are known without direct evidence. The feelings of boredom and loneliness stem from this assumption. This aligns with Mind Reading, where the individual presumes they know what others think or feel without confirmation.",Mind Reading

How could I pass the exam?","""the world was still unfair to me"", ""How could I pass the exam?""","The phrase ""the world was still unfair to me"" indicates a belief that external circumstances are persistently against the speaker. The question ""How could I pass the exam?"" implies a negative prediction about the future outcome without evidence. This reflects a form of anticipating failure or a negative event, which corresponds to the cognitive distortion known as Fortune-telling, where one predicts a negative future outcome without sufficient evidence.",Fortune-telling

It expresses a practical approach by emphasizing the importance of preparation, without imposing unrealistic demands or harsh self-criticism. There is no evidence of making negative predictions about the future (fortune-telling), assuming others' thoughts (mind reading), or emotionally reasoning based on feelings.

3045,My recent bad luck may be that I have done something in the past that offends something that cannot be offended.,My recent bad luck may be that I have done something in the past that offends something that cannot be offended.,"The statement implies that the speaker believes their recent bad luck is caused by having done something in the past that offended an entity which 'cannot be offended.' This represents an assumption about a cause-effect relationship based on an unverifiable internal belief without factual evidence. The speaker anticipates a negative outcome (bad luck) as a result of a prior action involving an intangible or abstract offender. This aligns with Fortune-telling, where the person predicts a future or ongoing negative consequence without concrete proof. It is not All-or-Nothing Thinking, as the statement does not present extremes. It is not Emotional Reasoning, as the speaker doesn't rely on feelings. It is not Labeling, Magnification, Mental filter, Mind Reading, Overgeneralization, Personalization, or Should statements, since those do not capture the anticipatory, predictive aspect inherent here.",Fortune-telling

The speaker claims that the friendship is over and that there is no possibility for it to develop further.

This reflects assigning a global label to oneself based on a specific behavior or situation, characteristic of the 'Labeling' distortion. It is not All-or-Nothing as there is no extreme success/failure dichotomy, no Emotional Reasoning since emotions aren't driving the conclusion, no Fortune-telling or Mind Reading involved, and no 'Should' statements or magnification. Therefore, the central distortion is labeling oneself negatively.",Labeling
3048,I don't know how to lose weight. I'm gonna get fat all the time.,"""I don't know how to lose weight"" and ""I'm gonna get fat all the time""","The phrase ""I'm gonna get fat all the time"" indicates a prediction about the future that assumes a negative outcome will always happen without considering other possibilities. The speaker is predicting continuous failure regarding their weight without evidence. This aligns with Fortune-telling, where someone predicts negative outcomes without sufficient basis. Although there is some hint of Overgeneralization with the use of ""all the time,"" the primary distortion is the unwarranted negative future prediction.",Fortune-telling
3049,"I don't usually work hard enough, so I can only protect myself, not necessarily, and if I'm strong enough, don't worry about it.","""I don't usually work hard enough"", ""so I can only protect myself"", ""not necessarily"", ""if I'm strong enough, don't worry about it""","The statement reflects a general conclusion about the speaker's work effort with the phrase ""I don't usually work hard enough,"" implying a broad, consistent failure. This generalization leads to the belief that the speaker can only protect themselves, suggesting a limited capability overall. The phrase ""I don't usually..."" signals the use of a broad, sweeping judgment based on past experiences. This fits the distortion of Overgeneralization, where one takes a single or limited set of experiences and applies them universally.",Overgeneralization

The speaker also expresses optimism about the future ('it'll be all right'). There is no evidence of negative cognitive distortions like exaggeration, all-or-nothing thinking, or labeling. Instead, the speaker realistically appraises the situation and shows acceptance and hope.",No Distortion
3051,I'm always looking forward to an early end of my work and a good night's sleep.,"""always looking forward to an early end of my work and a good night's sleep""","The statement indicates the speaker is consistently focused on wanting the workday to end early and to have a good night's sleep. The key word 'always' suggests a generalization applied to every instance without exception. This reflects a tendency to apply a single expectation broadly and rigidly, which fits the cognitive distortion of overgeneralization rather than other distortions that involve extreme thinking, emotional inference, or negative labeling.",Overgeneralization
3052,"Mom and Dad are doing this for my own good, just wait till the two sides calm down and apologize to them.","""Mom and Dad are doing this for my own good"", ""just wait till the two sides calm down and apologize to them""","The statement assumes that Mom and Dad's actions are inherently for the speaker's benefit without considering other motives or evidence (emotional reasoning). It also predicts a future scenario where both sides will calm down and apologize, which is an assumption about future events without certainty (fortune-telling). Among these, the dominant distortion is 'Fortune-telling' as the speaker predicts a future resolution (the calming down and apology) without evidence.",Fortune-telling
3053,I'm so tired. Why do you have so many jobs? I feel like I can't do it anymore.,"""I'm so tired"", ""Why do you have so many jobs?"", ""I feel like I can't do it anymore.""","The speaker expresses extreme fatigue and a sense of being overwhelmed, culminating in a belief that they 'can't do it anymore.' This reflects a conclusion about their ability based solely on their current emotional state and feelings of exhaustion. The statement is not about predicting the future (Fortune-telling), making broad conclusions (Overgeneralization), or judging oneself in an extreme way (Labeling). Instead, the individual is interpreting their feelings of tiredness as evidence that they are incapable, which is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning—believing something is true because of how one feels, regardless of objective reality.",Emotional Reasoning
3054,I'm tired of being so boring and not being cared for.,"""tired of being so boring"" and ""not being cared for""","The statement highlights a negative label applied to the self ('so boring'), which goes beyond a simple negative thought and directly names the person in a demeaning way. Additionally, the feeling of 'not being cared for' is expressed as a given fact without supporting evidence, but the more prominent distortion here is the labeling of the self as 'boring.' This fits best with 'Labeling,' where a person assigns a negative and absolute label to themselves instead of describing the specific behavior or situation.",Labeling
3055,"No matter how hard I try, it seems impossible to achieve the desired academic achievement, and perhaps I should give up everything completely.","""No matter how hard I try, it seems impossible to achieve the desired academic achievement""; ""perhaps I should give up everything completely""","The statement indicates a sense of absolute failure despite effort, as well as a drastic conclusion to give up entirely. The phrase 'no matter how hard I try' suggests all attempts are futile, and 'give up everything completely' reflects a black-and-white or extreme outcome. This pattern shows the individual is viewing the situation in absolutes without recognizing any middle ground or partial success, which aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3056,Don't you have a problem with me?,Don't you have a problem with me?,"The statement implies that the speaker assumes or predicts that the other person has a problem with them without any direct evidence.

I don't deserve it.","'If I wear a suit, I'm gonna wear it backwards.' and 'I don't deserve it.'","The statement predicts a negative future event ('I'm gonna wear it backwards') without evidence, which aligns with Fortune-telling. Additionally, 'I don't deserve it' reflects a negative self-judgment but does not specify a label like Labeling or Personalization. The primary distortion is the anticipation of failure regarding wearing the suit, indicating a prediction of negative outcome without basis.",Fortune-telling
3058,"I built the walls and took them apart, but they piled up around me, and I lost my sight and could barely breathe.","""I built the walls and took them apart, but they piled up around me"", ""I lost my sight and could barely breathe""","The statement uses metaphorical language describing a situation where the speaker feels overwhelmed by the consequences of their own actions ('I built the walls and took them apart, but they piled up around me'). The feeling of losing sight and struggling to breathe reflects an intense emotional response. This suggests that the speaker is interpreting their physical and emotional state based solely on their feelings rather than objective evidence. Hence, the distortion involves drawing conclusions about reality directly from emotional states, indicative of Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
3059,I'm in despair. I don't have my name on the list. How could that happen?,"""I'm in despair.""; ""I don't have my name on the list.""; ""How could that happen?""","The key phrase ""I'm in despair"" shows a strong emotional response. The speaker concludes their despair based solely on the fact that their name is not on the list, implying their emotional state is dictating their interpretation of the situation rather than objective evidence. The question ""How could that happen?"" suggests confusion or disbelief. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where one believes something is true because they feel it strongly, without necessarily having rational proof. There is no evidence of other distortions such as all-or-nothing thinking or fortune-telling here.",Emotional Reasoning
3060,Mom and Dad are so poor because they're stupid and lazy. I hate parents like that.,"""Mom and Dad are so poor because they're stupid and lazy"" and ""I hate parents like that.""","The statement attributes the cause of the parents' poverty solely to their supposed personal characteristics (stupid and lazy), which is a sweeping negative judgment labeling them in a degrading way. Furthermore, the phrase ""I hate parents like that"" generalizes this negative label to a wider group. This fits well with the cognitive distortion 'Labeling,' as it involves assigning a fixed and negative label to people based on limited information, rather than seeing the complexity of reasons or individual circumstances.",Labeling
3061,"I'm such a loser that everyone else can live a normal life in this situation, and I can't accept it.","""I'm such a loser"", ""everyone else can live a normal life"", ""I can't accept it""","The statement contains a negative global label ""loser"" applied to the self, which is a hallmark of the Labeling distortion. The speaker is not just describing a behavior or feeling but is attaching a negative identity label to themselves. Although there is an element of comparing self to others and emotional distress, the core distortion is Labeling because the self is being defined in broad, negative terms rather than focusing on specific actions or situations.",Labeling

There's no value in it!,"""The school doesn't even have a power system."" / ""What's the use of it?"" / ""There's no value in it!""","The speaker makes a harsh, absolute judgment about the school's value based solely on the absence of a power system. This indicates a black-or-white perspective with no middle ground or nuance considered. The statement suggests that because of one missing feature, the entire school's value is negated, which is typical of all-or-nothing thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

That's a small price.,"The statement acknowledges a consequence of performing illegal actions and rationalizes it as an acceptable trade-off. It implies a resignation or justification for engaging in behavior despite knowing negative outcomes. There is no absolute thinking (all-or-nothing), no negative labeling, no assumptions about others' thoughts (mind reading), no exaggeration (magnification), or predictions about the future (fortune-telling). The person is making a rationalization and accepting responsibility rather than distorting reality. Therefore, this does not fit with any cognitive distortion and is more about acceptance/justification.",No Distortion
3064,I can't even get a driver's license. My life is a failure.,"""I can't even get a driver's license."" and ""My life is a failure.""","The statement starts with a specific fact or difficulty ('I can't even get a driver's license') and immediately generalizes it to a broad, global negative judgment about the entire life ('My life is a failure'). This represents a pattern of thinking where one negative event or detail is taken to mean that everything about oneself or one's life is a failure. This fits the definition of overgeneralization, where a single event is seen as an unending pattern of defeat or failure.",Overgeneralization
3065,"Marriage is a big thing in our lives, but I can't do it right. What's the point of my life?","""I can't do it right""; ""What's the point of my life?""","The phrase ""I can't do it right"" suggests a rigid, black-and-white way of thinking about the speaker's ability to succeed in marriage, implying complete failure without any middle ground. This is characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where things are seen as either perfect or a total failure. The follow-up ""What's the point of my life?"" further amplifies the negative conclusion based on this absolute judgment, indicating no recognition of partial success or improvement. There is no direct evidence of other distortions like emotional reasoning (feeling as fact), fortune-telling (predicting the future), labeling (assigning negative labels), or others as listed.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

We'll catch up with the rest of the class now, at least not all of it.","'We'll catch up with the rest of the class now, at least not all of it.'","The statement expresses a realistic, moderate expectation. The speaker acknowledges they won't catch up with the entire class, but at least some of it. There is no evidence of extreme thinking, emotional justification, predicting negative outcomes, labeling, or other distortions. The phrasing indicates a practical, hopeful attitude toward the situation.",No Distortion

People are gonna respect me all the time.,"""He's probably gonna say something bad to me."" and ""People are gonna respect me all the time.""","The first part, ""He's probably gonna say something bad to me,"" reflects anticipating a negative outcome without evidence, which aligns with predicting the future negatively. This fits the definition of Fortune-telling, where one assumes negative events will occur without sufficient proof. The second part, ""People are gonna respect me all the time,"" is an unrealistic absolute expectation of constant respect, which looks like All-or-Nothing Thinking. Since the instruction is to pick one distortion, the dominant distortion in the initial worry is the predictive negative assumption (Fortune-telling), while the positive expectation could be a separate distortion but less dominant in context.",Fortune-telling
3068,"It's true, a parent's life, if he doesn't have a good education, his own children have no place to look.","a parent's life, if he doesn't have a good education, his own children have no place to look","The statement makes a sweeping generalization that if a parent lacks a good education, then the children will have no support or guidance ('no place to look'). This implies a broad, absolute conclusion without considering exceptions or nuances. This is characteristic of overgeneralization, where a single condition is believed to determine an overall negative outcome for the children.",Overgeneralization

The statement ""I'm not gonna do it again if I'm sick"" implies a strict rule about behavior contingent on illness, reflecting rigidity. The phrase ""It's horrible"" and the aversion to gaining weight reveal the speaker's negative valuation tied to this event, indicating a rigid 'should' or 'should not' belief system. This indicates the presence of a 'Should statement' distortion, where the person imposes inflexible demands on themselves about not gaining weight, especially when sick.",Should statements
3070,"Even if you go to class, you don't have to learn to sleep in the dormitory.","Even if you go to class, you don't have to learn to sleep in the dormitory.","The statement suggests a conclusion about learning (implying you won't learn anything useful or relevant) despite going to class, which implies a negative generalization about the outcome of an action. It assumes that attending class will not result in any meaningful learning related to dormitory life, generalizing a specific outcome in a negative way. However, it doesn't predict the future as a certainty, nor does it involve emotional reasoning, labeling, or thinking in absolute terms. The main cognitive distortion here is that it overgeneralizes the value or effect of attending class based on a perceived failure or disconnect, implying a broad, dismissive conclusion about the experience.",Overgeneralization
3071,"My back hurts because I don't have day-to-day exercise, and I'm too lazy to be sick if I work faster.","My back hurts because I don't have day-to-day exercise, and I'm too lazy to be sick if I work faster.","The statement attributes the back pain directly to the lack of daily exercise and self-labels as 'too lazy', implying a harsh judgment of character. The phrase 'I'm too lazy to be sick if I work faster' reflects a self-critical evaluation rooted in 'should' expectations about behavior (i.e., should exercise more and work faster to avoid being sick). This aligns with 'Should statements' where the person imposes rigid rules or expectations on themselves, leading to guilt or frustration.",Should statements
3072,What if I can't find a job? I don't want to be a burden to Mom and Dad.,"""What if I can't find a job?"" and ""I don't want to be a burden to Mom and Dad.""","The phrase ""What if I can't find a job?"" suggests the speaker is predicting a negative future outcome without evidence, which matches the characteristic of fortune-telling. The concern about being a burden reflects an assumption about future consequences based on this negative prediction. This is not necessarily all-or-nothing thinking, since it is not portraying an absolute outcome but rather anticipating a negative possibility. It is also not labeling or personalization, and no evidence of emotional reasoning or magnification is present. Therefore, the dominant distortion is fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

Why, this company's short of vases?","""HR is here to pick its own princess"", ""HR and the guys who got in, they're all good-looking"", ""this company's short of vases""","The statement implies that HR is biased in selecting attractive people ('pick its own princess'), suggesting a preconceived negative judgment on the hiring process. The phrase 'this company's short of vases' serves as a metaphor to label the selected employees merely as ornamental objects, dehumanizing and stereotyping them based on appearance. This reflects a fixed, negative label applied to people rather than considering nuanced factors. Therefore, this is an example of Labeling, which involves assigning a global, often derogatory, label to oneself or others.",Labeling
3074,I can't even educate my daughter. I can't do anything.,"""I can't even educate my daughter""; ""I can't do anything""","The statement involves two key phrases where the speaker negates their ability in a specific context (educating the daughter) and then extends this to a broad, global inability (can't do anything). This transition from one perceived failure to a sweeping negative judgment about the self is indicative of seeing situations in absolute terms without recognizing any middle ground or partial successes. This aligns with 'All-or-Nothing Thinking', which is characterized by viewing things in black-or-white categories.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3075,"I'm a midget. I'm an ugly, short, ugly man. I can't see.","""I'm a midget. I'm an ugly, short, ugly man.""","The statement involves the speaker assigning negative and overly simplistic labels to themselves based on certain characteristics. The repetition of 'ugly' and the use of the term 'midget' show a focus on defining the entire self with generalized, negative labels rather than describing specific behaviors or facts. This fits the pattern of 'Labeling,' where the individual negatively categorizes themselves in an absolute manner.",Labeling
3076,My life goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.,"""My life goes on and on and on and on..."" (repetition indicating endless continuation)","The statement emphasizes the continuous, never-ending nature of the speaker's life. This suggests a theme of exaggeration or extension beyond a reasonable interpretation, implying that the situation is unending without relief or change. Such repetition represents a broad conclusion drawn from a personal feeling or experience, extending it indefinitely. This fits the pattern of Overgeneralization, where a single or limited experience is generalized to an overall, absolute condition.",Overgeneralization
3077,"Although failure is possible, I'm going to try.","""Although failure is possible, I'm going to try.""","The statement acknowledges a potential negative outcome (failure), but it does not assume that failure will happen with certainty. Instead, it expresses a willingness to try despite the possibility. This shows a balanced perspective rather than predicting the future negatively (which would indicate Fortune-telling) or applying an extreme, black-and-white view (all-or-nothing thinking). There is no emotional reasoning, labeling, or other distortions present. The statement is realistic and adaptive.",No Distortion
3078,Neither research nor work can regret their choices and walk steadfastly along the path of their choice.,Neither research nor work can regret their choices and walk steadfastly along the path of their choice.,"The statement implies an absolute judgment that both research and work must either not regret their choices or must walk steadfastly without deviation. This presents a rigid either/or perspective without room for nuances or exceptions. Such thinking fits the pattern of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where situations are viewed in extreme, black-and-white terms.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3079,"Nobody wants to come and meet me, and I don't want to.","""Nobody wants to come and meet me, and I don't want to.""","The phrase 'Nobody wants to come and meet me' indicates a belief or assumption about others' desires without evidence, which aligns with 'Mind Reading'—assuming to know what others think or want. The addition 'and I don't want to' shows a personal withdrawal but does not alter the cognitive distortion present. Therefore, the key distortion lies in assuming others' intentions or feelings without confirmation.",Mind Reading

It's a pain in the ass. My God, it's a pain in the ass. What's the matter with me?""","The repetition of phrases like ""It's a pain in the ass"" emphasizes an intense negative perception. The speaker focuses solely on the discomfort and inconvenience, amplifying the frustration and distress they feel. There is no indication of balanced thinking or acknowledgment of any positive or neutral aspects. This suggests magnification, which involves exaggerating the negative aspects or the significance of a situation. Other distortions like labeling or all-or-nothing thinking don't fit as the speaker is not applying a global negative label to themselves or others, nor thinking in absolutes. Emotional reasoning is also less precise here, as the main cognitive distortion is the exaggeration of the pain's impact rather than reasoning solely based on feelings.",Magnification
3081,It's embarrassing. I've got to get out of here.,"""It's embarrassing."" ""I've got to get out of here.""","The statement reflects the speaker's feelings about a situation being embarrassing, which is a subjective emotional assessment. The phrase ""I've got to get out of here"" implies a reaction based on that emotional feeling. This is a case of Emotional Reasoning, where the person concludes the situation must be shameful or intolerable because they feel embarrassed, rather than based on objective evidence. There is no evidence of predicting the future (Fortune-telling), extremes (All-or-Nothing), or labeling oneself or others; instead, the reasoning is grounded in feeling embarrassed, which drives behavior.",Emotional Reasoning

They must have done nothing.,"""They stole it so many times"", ""They haven't caught me yet"", ""They're mad at me"", ""They must have done nothing""","The statement contains a generalization from repeated incidents: ""They stole it so many times"" implies repeated behavior, which leads to the conclusion ""They must have done nothing"". This implies drawing a broad conclusion based on limited evidence or repeated events. Additionally, ""They're mad at me"" infers the mental state of others without explicit confirmation, suggesting elements of mind reading. However, the dominant distortion is the broad conclusion from repeated incidents, which fits overgeneralization best.",Overgeneralization
3083,"Even if you marry someone you don't like, it's gonna have to go on and take a step, hey.","Even if you marry someone you don't like, it's gonna have to go on and take a step","The statement assumes a negative future outcome (marrying someone you don't like) and predicts that life will inevitably have to continue in a difficult way. It reflects a belief about an unavoidable and undesirable future event without evidence, indicating a prediction about the future. This matches the definition of 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts negative outcomes without sufficient proof.",Fortune-telling
3084,I can't get over it. I can't make it.,"""I can't get over it"", ""I can't make it""","The statement contains absolute language with the phrase ""I can't,"" indicating a complete inability or failure without any middle ground or nuances. This suggests an all-or-nothing perspective where the speaker views their situation in black-and-white terms, failing to consider partial success or gradual progress. Thus, it aligns most closely with All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This reflects the belief that the parents are intentionally causing suffering, which is an inference about their thoughts or motives. This aligns with 'Mind Reading', a distortion where one believes they know what others are thinking or intending without confirmation. While there are hints of personalization, the primary distortion is assuming deliberate intent by the parents, consistent with mind reading.",Mind Reading

This reflects assuming others' thoughts and feelings (mind reading). Additionally, the speaker sets an absolute condition about love and money, implying inflexible criteria. However, the primary distortion is interpreting others' feelings without evidence, which fits 'Mind Reading' best.",Mind Reading
3087,I'm sure my husband doesn't like me either.,"""I'm sure my husband doesn't like me either.""","The statement expresses a belief about what the husband thinks or feels without direct evidence, assuming the husband's negative feelings. This is a clear example of 'Mind Reading,' where one infers others' thoughts or feelings without confirmation. It is not 'Fortune-telling,' as the focus is on the husband's current feelings, not future outcomes. It is not 'Emotional Reasoning,' since the statement is about what the husband feels, not the speaker's emotions. Therefore, 'Mind Reading' best fits the cognitive distortion here.",Mind Reading
3088,That's why I'm so fat because I'm so weak.,"""I'm so fat because I'm so weak""","The statement links a personal attribute (being 'weak') directly as the cause of another characteristic (being 'fat'), implying a global, negative self-assessment. This reflects labeling, where a person assigns a negative, fixed label to themselves ('weak') which then defines other aspects of their identity ('I'm so fat'). It is not about predicting the future (fortune-telling), nor about all-or-nothing extremes, nor focusing on emotions alone. The primary distortion is the application of a negative label to oneself.",Labeling

The phrase 'can't even be a good student' generalizes a difficulty or failure in one area to a total inability. The use of the phrase 'a stupid, mentally weak person' exemplifies labeling, where the individual defines themselves with negative terms instead of describing specific behaviors or situations. Although there are elements suggesting overgeneralization ('can't even be a good student'), the dominant distortion is labeling because the person assigns global negative labels to their identity.",Labeling

Additionally, ""people get away from me"" suggests a perceived cause-effect relationship that others avoid the speaker, possibly reinforcing the negative self-label. The key here is the self-assigned negative label ""I'm dumb"", which goes beyond a specific behavior or event to a general identity judgment. This is distinct from Emotional Reasoning since the statement attributes a negative quality to the self rather than concluding truth solely based on feelings. Overgeneralization would be more about drawing broad conclusions from single events; here the focus is on the negative label about the self.",Labeling

This involves taking a single negative experience and applying it broadly to all people, a hallmark of overgeneralization. Although there is emotional involvement, the key distortion is the broad and absolute conclusion drawn from specific events. Hence, it does not primarily represent Emotional Reasoning (which focuses on feelings as proof of truth) or Mind Reading (assuming to know others' thoughts). Instead, the primary distortion is overgeneralizing from one event.",Overgeneralization

It takes one instance and applies it broadly to the speaker's entire value and social relationships, which is indicative of overgeneralization rather than a different distortion such as labeling or personalization.",Overgeneralization
3098,It's over. I can't remember. I'm useless.,"""It's over. I can't remember. I'm useless.""","The statement ""I'm useless"" is a negative global label applied to oneself based on a perceived failure or difficulty, which is characteristic of Labeling. ""It's over"" suggests a sense of finality which could hint at All-or-Nothing Thinking, but the strongest distortion is the self-judgment in ""I'm useless."" There's no prediction of the future (Fortune-telling), nor is there evidence of filtering, personalization, or should statements here. Thus, the dominant distortion is Labeling.",Labeling
3099,Why does this dog bite no one else? It must be because I smell something good.,"""Why does this dog bite no one else?

3100,"I think there's nothing I can do to restore my eyes, and I gave up treatment completely.","there's nothing I can do to restore my eyes, I gave up treatment completely","The statement reflects a belief that no action can improve the situation, implying an absolute and all-encompassing conclusion. The phrase 'there's nothing I can do' suggests a black-and-white thinking pattern, dismissing any possibility for partial or gradual improvement or alternative solutions. This rigid thinking style is characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where outcomes are perceived in extremes (total success or total failure) with no middle ground.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The speaker concludes that they will ""never be able"" to fit in with advanced designers or do design again. This shows an extreme perspective of all-or-nothing: either perfect eyes and ability or completely incapable forever. The phrasing ""never"" indicates a totalizing, black-and-white thinking pattern without middle ground or possibilities for improvement. While there is also some negative prediction (fortune-telling), the core distortion is the all-or-nothing perspective reflecting an absolute failure rather than a more probabilistic forecast.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3102,"Boys love nice, nice girls.","""Boys love nice, nice girls.""","The statement generalizes the preference of all boys towards a specific type of girl, assuming that all boys without exception love only 'nice' girls.

""I didn't look into the scope of the study.""","The statement expresses self-blame and takes responsibility for the issue, implying that the problem lies solely with the speaker. This reflects an internal attribution of fault. The speaker is personalizing the problem rather than considering other factors or shared responsibility. There is no evidence of extremes (all-or-nothing), predictions (fortune-telling), or emotional assumptions without evidence. The emphasis on it being ""my problem"" aligns with Personalization.",Personalization

This assumption aligns with 'Mind Reading,' as the speaker infers others' thoughts and feelings. The phrase 'few contacts with their families' sets a context but does not distort reasoning itself. The decision 'not to contact them' is an action taken based on this assumption, reinforcing the distortion.",Mind Reading

""It's my fault.""","The speaker repeatedly blames themselves for the failure, taking full responsibility for the outcome. This indicates personalization, where the individual attributes external events or failures solely to themselves, even if not entirely their fault. The phrase ""I can't even do this little thing right now"" shows self-blame at a personal level. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking (no extremes stated), emotional reasoning (no feelings used as proof), fortune-telling (no predictions), labeling (no global negative labels), magnification (no exaggeration), mental filter (no selective focus), mind reading (no assumptions about others' thoughts), overgeneralization (no broad conclusions), or should statements (no prescriptive statements). Therefore, personalization best fits.",Personalization

3108,My family doesn't want to contact me. They don't like me anymore.,"""My family doesn't want to contact me."" ""They don't like me anymore.""","The statement assumes without evidence that the family's lack of contact means they don't like the speaker anymore. This reflects a belief about others' thoughts/feelings without direct knowledge or confirmation, which aligns with mind reading. It is not about exaggerated outcomes (Fortune-telling), nor about thinking in black-and-white terms (All-or-Nothing). The speaker is attributing feelings to others based on behavior, which matches Mind Reading distortion.",Mind Reading

""I'd better run away from home as far away as possible and leave them alone.""","The statement reflects an assumption that the speaker's presence or actions are causing others sadness, implying personal responsibility for their emotions, which aligns with personalization. The decision to 'run away from home as far away as possible and leave them alone' suggests an extreme response based on the belief that they are the direct cause of others' sadness. This is not about predicting the future (fortune-telling), nor is it about seeing things in black-and-white terms (all-or-nothing). It is not about interpreting others' thoughts (mind reading), nor is it about labeling oneself or others.

It's so unfair.,"""Why do I have to do this so hard?"" and ""It's so unfair.""","The speaker is expressing frustration over the difficulty of a task and perceiving the situation as unfair. This reflects a focus on the emotional response (feeling that the situation is unfair) as evidence for the situation's nature, rather than an objective evaluation. The phrase ""It's so unfair"" demonstrates making a judgment based on the emotional discomfort experienced. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as fact.",Emotional Reasoning

I don't want to do anything, or I'll have no more questions.","""I'm living under oppression and power.""; ""I don't want to do anything, or I'll have no more questions.""","The phrase ""I'm living under oppression and power"" suggests a perception of a controlling or overwhelming external force, indicating a general negative viewpoint about the situation. The following statement, ""I don't want to do anything, or I'll have no more questions,"" implies a belief that taking any action will result in losing all curiosity or engagement, suggesting a rigid either/or scenario. This reflects a black-and-white perspective where the person believes there are only two extreme outcomes if they act or don't act. This aligns with 'All-or-Nothing Thinking,' where situations are viewed in absolutes rather than on a continuum.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

I shouldn't trust anyone.,"""I'll always be betrayed by my friends"", ""I shouldn't trust anyone""","The phrase ""I'll always be betrayed by my friends"" implies a sweeping conclusion about all friends based on past or current experiences, suggesting that betrayal will occur every time without exception. This is a classic example of extending one or few instances to an absolute, future expectation. Similarly, ""I shouldn't trust anyone"" generalizes the distrust to all people universally. This reflects making a broad, generalized statement from limited evidence, which fits the definition of overgeneralization. The statement is not about rigid categories (all-or-nothing), nor purely about interpreting emotions as facts (emotional reasoning), nor predicting the future as certain (fortune-telling). It's primarily about extending specific experiences to an absolute rule.",Overgeneralization

I hate working.""","The phrase ""I'll live like this forever"" shows a prediction about the future with a negative, definitive outcome, without evidence. This is an example of assuming a future situation will remain permanently bad. This fits the definition of Fortune-telling, where one predicts negative outcomes about future events without sufficient proof. The other parts of the statement express frustration and negative feelings but do not represent other distortions as clearly.",Fortune-telling

I must be funny in people's eyes.","""I always say I want to lose weight, but I never lose weight."" and ""I must be funny in people's eyes.""","The first part of the statement, ""I always say I want to lose weight, but I never lose weight,"" shows a pattern of overgeneralization by using ""always"" and ""never"" to describe the speaker's behavior, implying a consistent failure without exceptions. The second part, ""I must be funny in people's eyes,"" reflects assuming others' perceptions without evidence, indicative of mind reading. However, since the task is to select only one distortion and the dominant theme in the statement is the sweeping generalization about weight loss efforts using absolute terms, the primary distortion is Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
3118,When will my sleep disorder be better? I can only feel endless torture.,"""I can only feel endless torture""","The statement expresses a feeling of continuous, unending suffering based solely on the person's current emotional experience. It uses the emotional state (feeling tortured) as evidence that the situation (sleep disorder) is unbearable and will not improve. This reflects the cognitive distortion of Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are treated as facts without objective support.",Emotional Reasoning

This is a prediction about the future that assumes a worst-case scenario will happen. The statement does not consider alternative outcomes and treats this negative result as inevitable, which aligns with fortune-telling - predicting future events negatively without sufficient evidence.",Fortune-telling
3120,I'm an abandoned son of the world. I've been abandoned by life.,"""I'm an abandoned son of the world"", ""I've been abandoned by life""",The speaker uses a broad and absolute term 'abandoned son of the world' and claims complete abandonment by 'life' itself. This indicates taking one negative experience or feeling and applying it universally to themselves and their entire existence. This kind of sweeping generalization from a specific event or feeling to a broad and global conclusion exemplifies overgeneralization.,Overgeneralization

The person is assigning a negative label to themselves rather than describing the situation objectively. This is characteristic of the cognitive distortion called Labeling, where one defines themselves by negative traits or perceived flaws rather than viewing their behavior or situation neutrally or contextually.",Labeling

It predicts future social rejection without concrete evidence, essentially guessing what others will think or do. This involves predicting the future negatively without certainty, which aligns with Fortune-telling. Although there is an element of mind reading (assuming others' negative judgment), the core distortion lies in predicting the future outcome of rejection, thus Fortune-telling is the best fit.",Fortune-telling

I don't want to put it on.,"""They must think I'm in trouble to call me.""","The statement includes the assumption about others' thoughts without direct evidence, specifically that 'they must think I'm in trouble.' This indicates inferring what others are thinking without verification. The second sentence, 'I don't want to put it on,' shows avoidance but is not a distortion itself.

3126,Makes me take-out in the middle of the night and deserves to be stolen.,Makes me take-out in the middle of the night; deserves to be stolen,"The statement blames an external cause ('makes me take-out in the middle of the night') leading to a negative action or feeling, and then assigns a harsh judgment ('deserves to be stolen') without evidence of actual behavior or outcome. The phrase 'deserves to be stolen' indicates labeling someone or something negatively based on a reaction or behavior. It does not portray black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), predictions of the future (Fortune-telling), or interpreting feelings as facts (Emotional Reasoning). It is not about filtering or focusing on one negative aspect alone (Mental filter). The statement is assigning a negative label, fitting the distortion known as Labeling.",Labeling
3127,I've touched the fish in class. It's all part of my duty to fish in class.,"""I've touched the fish in class."" ""It's all part of my duty to fish in class.""","The statement shows the speaker rationalizing or justifying their action (touching the fish in class) by framing it as a duty. This indicates they are accepting their behavior because they believe it is required for their role or responsibility. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or any other distortion such as fortune-telling, labeling, or personalization. Instead, the statement appears to be a straightforward explanation without cognitive distortion. Therefore, the best fitting category is No Distortion.",No Distortion
3128,Forget it. I'll lose anyway. Just keep looking at the phone.,"""I'll lose anyway""","The phrase ""I'll lose anyway"" reflects a prediction about the future outcome without any evidence, assuming failure as a certainty.

The belief that ""she certainly doesn't think I'm good enough"" reflects assuming the other person's thoughts without direct evidence. However, the primary distortion is the assumption that the other person is constantly in opposition with the speaker and actively trying to ""crush"" them, which exaggerates the situation and reflects seeing things in a black-and-white manner.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3130,I've got to figure out a way to fix this.,I've got to figure out a way to fix this.,"The statement expresses a sense of obligation or necessity ('I've got to') to resolve a problem.

I can't lose.""","The statement emphasizes that the case outcome will definitively determine the speaker's career and that losing is not an option, implying a black-and-white perspective. This reflects a rigid way of thinking where there are only two possible outcomes: success or complete failure, without acknowledging any middle ground or other possibilities. The phrase ""I can't lose"" strongly suggests an all-or-nothing approach, indicating that anything less than perfect success is unacceptable.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

Coupled with ""I've wanted to die,"" it reflects an extreme view of the situation as unchanging and entirely negative. This indicates a broad conclusion drawn from a single aspect or experience, which is characteristic of Overgeneralization. There is no indication of dichotomous thinking (all-or-nothing), assumptions about others' thoughts (mind reading), or focusing on a single detail (mental filter). The statement also does not involve predicting the future (fortune-telling) or imposing moral imperatives (should statements). Emotional reasoning might be involved, but the predominant distortion is a sweeping conclusion based on extended experience, which is Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

Give it up.,"""It's hard"", ""I don't want to waste any more time"", ""Give it up""","The statement starts by acknowledging difficulty ('It's hard'), then concludes with a definitive decision to stop trying ('Give it up'). This reflects a black-and-white view—either succeed easily or quit entirely—rather than considering continued effort or gradual progress. This kind of rigid dichotomous thinking fits 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' most closely. The person is not entertaining nuanced alternatives but instead presenting a binary choice.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3135,I still don't have a clear mind. I'd like to get some more sleep.,"""I still don't have a clear mind"" and ""I'd like to get some more sleep.""","The statement expresses a current feeling of mental cloudiness and a desire to improve it by getting more sleep. It does not predict future outcomes (ruling out Fortune-telling), nor does it label oneself negatively or apply extreme thinking. The speaker is reflecting on their emotional or cognitive state but is not reasoning purely from emotions alone; rather, they recognize a tangible cause (lack of sleep). This indicates awareness and a realistic assessment of the situation. There is no evidence of distorted cognitive patterns such as all-or-nothing, magnification, personalization, or mind reading.",No Distortion

The phrase ""I can't help it"" indicates acceptance of the situation rather than an irrational or distorted interpretation.

The speaker expresses gratitude and a positive view about their parents based on the experience of the last three years. There is no evidence of distortions like black-and-white thinking, negative labeling, or predicting the future. The perspective is balanced, acknowledging flaws but emphasizing kindness, without jumping to negative or exaggerated conclusions. The attitude is positive and realistic.",No Distortion

The phrase ""It's all my fault"" indicates taking excessive responsibility for events outside direct control, consistent with personalization. Additionally, the global blame to one's sexual orientation as shaming the whole family suggests an internalized fault and personalized perception of impact. No other distortions such as mind reading or labeling fit as precisely, because the focus here is on self-blaming rather than predicting others' thoughts or applying negative labels.",Personalization

This reflects labeling as it assigns a harsh, global negative label ('unattractive piece of shit') to the speaker based on a single event or behavior. It is not just about interpreting an event negatively but rather self-identifying with a degrading label. Other distortions such as fortune-telling (predicting the future), emotional reasoning (assuming feelings are facts), or all-or-nothing thinking (black-and-white perspective) are less precise here because the core issue is the harsh global label assigned to the self.",Labeling

The second part, ""can't even see what he's got,"" reflects a negative self-assessment but is less specific to other distortion types. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking (no absolute terms like 'always' or 'never'), emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, magnification, or personalization. Thus, the main distortion is Labeling.",Labeling

I feel a little lonely.,"""I don't have any friends here right now"", ""I feel a little lonely""","The statement acknowledges a current fact that the person does not have friends in the immediate environment. They then express a feeling of loneliness based on that fact. This is an example of Emotional Reasoning, where the individual interprets their current emotion (loneliness) as evidence of their social situation.

3147,That's all I can do. I can't go to a good company.,That's all I can do. I can't go to a good company.,"The statement implies a permanent limitation or an absolute boundary ('I can't go to a good company') with no middle ground or exceptions, reflecting a black-and-white perspective. This reflects an extreme outlook without considering other possibilities or gradations, which is characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking. It does not predict the future with certainty (Fortune-telling), nor does it generalize beyond the specific scenario (Overgeneralization). It also lacks elements of emotional judgment as factual evidence (Emotional Reasoning), nor does it assign negative labels.

""It's impossible to make friends.""","The sentence first expresses a strong fear or feeling (""I'm so afraid"") which might suggest emotional reasoning, but the key part is the statement ""It's impossible to make friends."" This is a prediction about the future that there is no chance to make friends, which is an unfounded negative prediction. This fits the definition of fortune-telling—predicting negative outcomes without evidence. It is not all-or-nothing thinking, as the speaker doesn't present a dichotomous scenario but an absolute negative future forecast. Hence, the dominant distortion is fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

This matches the definition of 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts something negative will happen and acts based on that prediction.",Fortune-telling
3151,"Is it because I fought with him last time that she didn't want to go home because I'm so angry, I'm such an incompetent parent, I'm sorry for my daughter.","fought with him last time, she didn't want to go home, I'm so angry, I'm such an incompetent parent, I'm sorry for my daughter","The statement shows the person linking the daughter's unwillingness to go home directly to their previous fight, blaming themselves for the daughter's behavior. Additionally, the speaker labels themselves as 'incompetent' based on this situation. This indicates a tendency to personalize the daughter's reaction and to apply a negative label to themselves. Although emotional reasoning ('I'm so angry') is present, the key distortion centers on blaming oneself for another's behavior and assigning a negative self-label.",Personalization
3152,I should spend more time with him before he leaves and join him in the sights he has never seen.,"""I should spend more time with him before he leaves""","The key phrase uses the word 'should,' indicating an internal demand or obligation. This suggests the person is setting a rule or expectation on themselves about what they must do. The presence of 'should' statements reflects a cognitive distortion where one believes things must be a certain way, often leading to guilt or pressure. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, or other distortions here.",Should statements
3153,I'll never lose my husband's love. We'll never go back.,"""I'll never lose my husband's love."" ""We'll never go back.""","The statements express absolute, unqualified outcomes about future events, indicating a black-and-white view without middle ground. The use of 'never' signals a categorical, all-or-nothing perspective, suggesting things are either entirely true or entirely false with no intermediate possibility. This fits the hallmark of All-or-Nothing Thinking rather than other distortions like Fortune-telling (which guesses future outcomes but not in such absolutes) or Overgeneralization (which generalizes from one event to many).",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3154,I'd rather not sign up and stay in the bedroom.,I'd rather not sign up and stay in the bedroom,"The statement reflects an avoidance behavior, implying withdrawal rather than engagement. It does not show absolute terms (like all-or-nothing), making predictions of the future (fortune-telling), or attributing intentions or thoughts to others (mind reading). It does not reflect negative self-labeling, excessive magnification, or filtering events. There is no statement of how things 'should' be or emotional reasoning based on feelings. Instead, it suggests a preference to avoid a situation, but without explicit distortion types related to distorted thinking patterns other than showing withdrawal which can be linked to resignation rather than cognitive distortion. However, among the given options, this closest aligns with a lack of proactive behavior commonly observed in emotional reasoning or avoidance behavior. Since emotional reasoning involves interpreting situations based on feelings rather than facts, the preference to stay in the bedroom may result from an internal feeling state (e.g., anxiety or fear), causing the decision not to engage. Therefore, the most appropriate label is Emotional Reasoning, as the action is influenced by an internal emotional state rather than objective reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
3155,It's really bad to be his student. It's a bad morning.,"""It's really bad to be his student."" ""It's a bad morning.""","The first phrase categorically states that being his student is 'really bad,' which is a black-and-white judgment without nuance. This suggests an extreme, absolute evaluation typical of All-or-Nothing Thinking. The second phrase, 'It's a bad morning,' could be a momentary perception but does not change the categorical nature of the first phrase. Therefore, the main distortion here lies in the absolute negative labeling of the situation without any middle ground or exceptions.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3156,My parents are my burden. Will they be better off when they leave me?,"""My parents are my burden"" and ""Will they be better off when they leave me?""","The statement implies that the speaker believes their parents are a burden because of them, which suggests personalization, where one assumes excessive responsibility for others' problems. Additionally, the question about whether the parents would be better off leaving shows a negative assumption about the impact the speaker has on their parents, which can be linked to personalization. There is no clear all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling (predicting the future with certainty), emotional reasoning, or labeling here. The speaker is attributing blame and responsibility to themselves unnecessarily.",Personalization
3157,"Anyway, I've got to go, so I don't have to protect myself. I'll be out on the street in a minute.","I've got to go, so I don't have to protect myself. I'll be out on the street in a minute.","The statement implies a prediction about a negative future event ('I'll be out on the street in a minute'), indicating an assumption that something bad will definitely happen without any concrete evidence. This reflects a form of negative forecasting, where the individual predicts an undesirable outcome with certainty.",Fortune-telling
3158,"Doctors and parents told me there was no problem, so I guess there's no problem.","""Doctors and parents told me there was no problem"", ""so I guess there's no problem.""","The statement relies entirely on the authorities' statements (doctors and parents) to conclude there is no problem. The speaker uses an external source’s opinion as definitive proof without direct evidence or personal evaluation. This reflects Emotional Reasoning because the speaker assumes the truth of a situation based on the perceived trustworthiness or reassurance of others, rather than independent validation. It is not All-or-Nothing thinking because there is no absolute either/or conclusion declared; it is not Fortune-telling because the speaker isn't predicting the future. It doesn't involve Labeling, Magnification, Mental filter, Mind Reading, Overgeneralization, Personalization, or Should statements, since those distortions do not apply to this reasoning process. Therefore, the closest fit is Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning
3159,"I'm a sinner, they're cold violence and I'm normal.","""I'm a sinner"", ""they're cold violence"", ""I'm normal""","The phrase ""I'm a sinner"" assigns a negative, global label to oneself based on an action or perceived character flaw, which is characteristic of Labeling. The phrase ""they're cold violence"" similarly assigns a harsh, absolute label to others rather than describing specific behaviors or situations. Finally, stating ""I'm normal"" might imply a contrasting identity but does not alleviate the labeling in the negative statements. The key distortion here is applying broad, fixed labels to oneself and others, rather than nuanced or situational descriptions.",Labeling
3160,I can't do anything but hurt someone who loves me.,"""I can't do anything but hurt someone who loves me.""","The statement suggests a broad generalization that the speaker is incapable of doing anything positive and will always cause harm to loved ones. This reflects a pattern where a single negative outcome is extended to all related actions or possibilities, indicative of overgeneralizing from one experience to all future instances.",Overgeneralization
3161,"I feel like life is so unfair to me, I'm always sick at an important moment, and I'm going crazy under this endless pressure!","""life is so unfair to me"", ""I'm always sick at an important moment"", ""I'm going crazy under this endless pressure""","The statement expresses a perception that life is generally unjust specifically to the speaker, highlighted by the word ""always"" which implies a pattern beyond a single occurrence. This indicates drawing a broad conclusion based on some events, which is a hallmark of overgeneralization. The speaker is interpreting a few unfortunate events as an ongoing, pervasive pattern of misfortune. There is also an emotional component, but the core distortion is the overgeneralized belief that these negative experiences happen all the time and define their experience.",Overgeneralization
3162,"I'm just not coming home at night, and my father's so angry, he's sure he's not satisfied with anything else. I must have been a disappointed child in his eyes.","""my father's so angry, he's sure he's not satisfied with anything else""; ""I must have been a disappointed child in his eyes""","The statement assumes the father's thoughts and feelings without direct evidence - ""he's sure he's not satisfied with anything else"" indicates the speaker believes they know exactly what the father is thinking and feeling. Furthermore, the speaker concludes they must have been a disappointed child from the father's perspective, which is also an assumption about the father's judgment. This fits the cognitive distortion of Mind Reading, where one presumes to know another person's internal state or opinions without confirmation.",Mind Reading
3163,I've never been punished for this. I'm no longer a good student from now on.,"""I've never been punished for this."" and ""I'm no longer a good student from now on.""","The first phrase implies that because the speaker has never been punished before, they now conclude that they will no longer be a good student. This involves drawing a broad and absolute conclusion about their character based on a past experience. The statement ""I'm no longer a good student from now on"" reflects a rigid, all-or-nothing evaluation without considering nuances or intermediate possibilities. This aligns with 'All-or-Nothing Thinking', where situations are seen in black-and-white terms without acknowledging gray areas.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3164,"My parents are always fighting, they're always very violent, and I'm really sorry, they're my favorite people, and I can't choose who to help.","""My parents are always fighting"", ""they're always very violent"", ""I'm really sorry"", ""I can't choose who to help""","The statement contains the words 'always' twice, signaling an absolute term which is a hallmark of overgeneralization. The speaker is taking specific instances of fighting and violence and generalizing them as always occurring. This exaggerates the frequency/intensity of the events. Although there is an emotional element and a dilemma expressed, the dominant cognitive distortion is the overgeneralization due to the use of 'always' implying no exceptions. There is no evidence of labeling (assigning a fixed negative trait), fortune-telling (predicting the future), or other distortions as primary.",Overgeneralization
3165,I can't escape their control and they won't let me leave them even if they get married. My future will be so unfree and painful.,"""I can't escape their control"", ""they won't let me leave them even if they get married"", ""My future will be so unfree and painful.""","The statement asserts a negative outcome with certainty about the future, predicting a lack of freedom and persistent pain. This involves anticipating inevitable negative events without evidence. The phrase 'won't let me leave' assumes others' intentions and behaviors, but the main distortion lies in predicting a negatively fixed future. This fits the definition of Fortune-telling, where one predicts bad outcomes as certain.",Fortune-telling
3166,"People like her, they're lazy and stupid. They don't even know how to get into college.","""People like her"", ""they're lazy and stupid"", ""They don't even know how to get into college.""","The statement makes a broad negative judgment about a group of people ('People like her') by attributing negative characteristics ('lazy and stupid') to all of them. It also assumes a specific failure ('don't even know how to get into college') applies universally to this group. This is a clear example of generalizing one or a few observations about individuals to an entire group, which fits the definition of Overgeneralization. There is no indication of extreme dichotomous thinking (All-or-Nothing), emotional basis (Emotional Reasoning), or attempting to predict the future (Fortune-telling). It is not simply labeling a single behavior or person, but rather applying a broad negative label to a whole group, typical of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

This indicates categorizing oneself with a negative global label rather than focusing on specific instances or facts. The phrase ""I'm a sick person"" is a classic example of labeling, where the individual assigns a fixed, negative identity to themselves. Other elements like ""My body's so bad"" and ""I can't walk"" support the negative label but do not show other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking or fortune-telling.",Labeling
3168,"It's kind of hard to study, but everyone else thinks I'm not gonna make it, and then they're gonna laugh at me.","""everyone else thinks I'm not gonna make it, and then they're gonna laugh at me""","The statement assumes other people's thoughts and intentions without direct evidence—believing that others think negatively about the speaker's chances and will laugh at them. This is a classic example of assuming to know what others are thinking, which corresponds to the cognitive distortion known as mind reading.",Mind Reading
3169,It's not worth it. I deserve it. Who made me gay?,"""It's not worth it."" ""I deserve it."" ""Who made me gay?""","The phrase ""It's not worth it"" indicates a negative judgment possibly influenced by emotional state, but is more declarative. ""I deserve it"" reflects a self-blaming attitude, implying the person is taking personal responsibility for something negative, which aligns with personalization. The question ""Who made me gay?"" implies an external attribution, but framed as blame or responsibility, which can also reflect personalization or externalization. Among these, the strongest cognitive distortion is the personalization component where the individual assumes fault or responsibility for their identity or situation, blaming themselves ('I deserve it') for something that objectively is not under personal control.",Personalization
3170,I'm in a bad mood. The world is a fantasy. I'd rather die.,"""I'm in a bad mood. The world is a fantasy. I'd rather die.""","The statement begins by describing an emotional state ('I'm in a bad mood') and then makes a broad, negative claim about reality ('The world is a fantasy'), implying that the external world is fundamentally flawed or unreal in a negative sense. This is followed by an extreme emotional conclusion ('I'd rather die'). The reasoning appears to be based on the individual's current feelings influencing their judgment about reality ('I'm in a bad mood' leading to 'the world is a fantasy'). This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where one's feelings are taken as evidence of truth regardless of objective reality.",Emotional Reasoning
3171,"Slowly, someone has to go through this step, develop themselves, improve their abilities.","Slowly, someone has to go through this step, develop themselves, improve their abilities.","The statement implies a necessity or obligation ('has to') to go through a process of development and improvement. This 'has to' phrasing suggests a prescriptive or demanding belief about what must happen, which aligns with the cognitive distortion known as 'Should statements,' where people impose rigid rules or expectations on themselves or others.",Should statements
3172,I talked to them. I'm an adult. I should talk to them about my way of life.,"""I'm an adult. I should talk to them about my way of life.""","The phrase 'I should talk to them about my way of life' reflects the use of 'should' statements, which are cognitive distortions involving rigid rules or expectations about how one or others must behave. The speaker is imposing an internal obligation on themselves based on their identity as an adult, which fits the 'Should statements' distortion category.",Should statements
3173,"They just want to control me and make me a money-making tool at their disposal. It's horrible, they never care what I feel!","""They just want to control me and make me a money-making tool at their disposal."" ""They never care what I feel!""","The statement attributes motives and intentions to others ('They just want to control me', 'They never care what I feel!') without direct evidence, implying the speaker is assuming others' thoughts and feelings. This fits the definition of Mind Reading, where one believes they know what others think or feel without confirmation. Although there is a negative emotional tone, it is secondary to the core distortion of assuming others' intentions and feelings. Therefore, Mind Reading is the most appropriate cognitive distortion here.",Mind Reading
3174,It's hard for me to lose someone. I can't accept it.,"""It's hard for me to lose someone."" ""I can't accept it.""","The statement expresses a strong emotional response ('It's hard for me to lose someone') and a belief tied to that emotion ('I can't accept it'). This reflects an interpretation based on feeling overwhelmed or unable to cope, rather than a logical assessment of the situation. The speaker assumes their emotional state (difficulty and inability to accept) as evidence of the reality of the situation, which is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning. There is no clear indication of other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or overgeneralization.",Emotional Reasoning
3175,"Now that he's given me these jobs, that's what he knows can be done.","Now that he's given me these jobs, that's what he knows can be done.","The statement assumes knowledge about what 'he' knows based purely on the jobs given. It interprets the tasks assigned as a direct reflection of the other person's perception or knowledge, without explicit evidence. This involves attributing specific thoughts or beliefs to another person without concrete proof, which fits the definition of mind reading.",Mind Reading
3176,I've been really busy. I haven't been in touch with my family for a long time. My parents must be complaining that I'm ignoring them.,My parents must be complaining that I'm ignoring them.,"The statement assumes knowledge about the parents' thoughts or feelings without any direct evidence, presuming they are complaining. This fits the pattern of 'Mind Reading,' where one believes they know what others are thinking or feeling without confirmation.",Mind Reading
3177,I can't just sit there and wait a little bit longer for the takeout to be stolen.,"""I can't just sit there and wait a little bit longer for the takeout to be stolen.""","The statement assumes that if the speaker waits even a little longer, the takeout will definitely be stolen. This is predicting a negative outcome without evidence, reflecting a false certainty about the future. This fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts a negative event will happen without actual proof.",Fortune-telling
3178,"When I was young, I didn't work well and I couldn't get married.","""I didn't work well""; ""I couldn't get married""","The statement links two events from the past to imply a generalized failing: because the speaker 'didn't work well' when young, they conclude they 'couldn't get married.' This suggests a broad negative conclusion based on limited evidence, applying a single attribute or event to an overall life outcome. This is characteristic of overgeneralization, where one infers a sweeping negative conclusion from specific instances.",Overgeneralization
3179,You must have looked down on me in front of the hotel.,"""You must have looked down on me in front of the hotel.""","The key phrase ""You must have looked down on me"" indicates a belief about another person's thoughts or feelings without direct evidence. The statement assumes knowledge of the other person's internal state or judgment. This matches the definition of Mind Reading, which involves assuming we know what others are thinking or feeling.",Mind Reading
3180,I'm in the middle of a career. I'll spend more time with my family when I get to the top!,"""I'll spend more time with my family when I get to the top!""","The statement assumes a future event ('getting to the top') will directly lead to a change in behavior (spending more time with family) without considering other possibilities or uncertainties. This reflects predicting a future outcome with certainty, which corresponds to 'Fortune-telling'. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, or other distortions listed, making 'Fortune-telling' the most accurate label.",Fortune-telling
3181,"They're nice to me, but I still want to find my own parents.","""They're nice to me, but I still want to find my own parents.""","The statement acknowledges a positive situation ('They're nice to me'), yet despite this shows a desire to pursue something else ('I still want to find my own parents'). There is no evidence of polarized or extreme thinking, no assumptions about others' thoughts or future events, no negative labeling, or belief based on emotions alone. The 'but' conjunction indicates an acknowledgment of mixed feelings rather than distortion. The speaker is expressing a personal preference or value without distorting reality or reasoning.",No Distortion
3182,"I haven't studied the subjects of the examinations, they're like a notice of failure, and I'm sure it's a terrible test.","""they're like a notice of failure"", ""I'm sure it's a terrible test""","The statement shows the person predicting a negative outcome without factual evidence, such as assuming the exam is a 'notice of failure' and that it will be 'terrible.' This involves making a negative prediction about the future, which aligns with the distortion of Fortune-telling. The person is not simply feeling bad (emotional reasoning) or thinking in extremes (all-or-nothing), but is forecasting failure and a bad test result without proof.",Fortune-telling
3183,I'm the only one who's ready to get a job. I don't want to be an alien.,"""I'm the only one who's ready to get a job"", ""I don't want to be an alien""","The phrase ""I'm the only one who's ready to get a job"" generalizes the situation to imply that no one else is prepared, based on limited or possibly no evidence. This reflects a broad conclusion drawn from a single or few instances, which is indicative of overgeneralization. The statement ""I don't want to be an alien"" highlights a feeling of isolation or being different, reinforcing the sense of being alone in readiness. There is no clear indication of all-or-nothing thinking (no strict either/or), emotional reasoning (feeling based without logic), or mind reading (assuming others' thoughts), so overgeneralization fits best.",Overgeneralization
3184,My real parents lost me because they didn't like me.,My real parents lost me because they didn't like me.,"The statement assumes knowing the specific reason ('because they didn't like me') for the parents losing the speaker, without any evidence. This reflects assuming knowledge about others' thoughts or feelings without confirmation. The key aspect is the assumption about what the parents were thinking or feeling, which aligns with mind reading. It is not all-or-nothing, emotional reasoning, or other distortions listed. Therefore, the distortion is Mind Reading.",Mind Reading

I'll never do anything!","""I must have been a failed student"", ""I'm doomed to do nothing"", ""I'll never do anything!""","The statement contains self-labeling as a 'failed student' based on a single event (not getting a scholarship), which fits the definition of Labeling—a cognitive distortion where a person assigns a global negative label to themselves. Additionally, the phrases ""I'm doomed to do nothing"" and ""I'll never do anything"" indicate a broad negative conclusion about the future based on current failure, which indicates Overgeneralization. However, since the core of the distortion begins with assigning a negative label to self and then projecting a negative outcome, the primary distortion here is Labeling. The other distortions like Fortune-telling and All-or-Nothing Thinking are secondary but less prominent than Labeling.",Labeling
3186,"I've got plenty of ducks, and I can't be scared of a little setback. I'm going to fight ducks to the end of the day.",I can't be scared of a little setback; I'm going to fight ducks to the end of the day.,"The speaker shows determination not to let any setback affect them, implying they must either completely succeed or not be scared at all. This reflects a binary way of thinking where challenges are either fully overcome or cause failure, which aligns with the concept of all-or-nothing thinking. There is no evidence of predicting the future (fortune-telling), emotional reasoning, or other distortions listed. The use of 'little setback' and commitment to 'fight ducks to the end' suggests a black-and-white, either/or mindset rather than a more nuanced one.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3187,"I think it's normal, not every company suits me, and I sort out the mood and go looking for the next company.","""it's normal"", ""not every company suits me"", ""sort out the mood and go looking for the next company""","The statement acknowledges that not every company will be a good fit, which reflects a realistic acceptance rather than an absolute or exaggerated belief. The speaker does not jump to negative conclusions or apply a global judgment but instead recognizes variability and plans to move forward. This shows a balanced perspective without cognitive distortion such as all-or-nothing thinking or overgeneralization.",No Distortion
3188,"My favorite kids do this to me. I'm so sad. Why is this happening? I don't blame them anymore, I don't deserve to be a good mother.","""My favorite kids do this to me"", ""I'm so sad"", ""Why is this happening?"", ""I don't blame them anymore"", ""I don't deserve to be a good mother.""","The speaker expresses sadness due to a specific behavior by their kids, questioning why it is happening, which could suggest emotional distress. The phrase ""I don't deserve to be a good mother"" indicates that the speaker attributes the negative event to a flaw or inherent deficiency in themselves rather than external factors. This indicates Personalization, where the individual takes responsibility for events or outcomes that may be outside their control. Although there is emotional reasoning present ('I'm so sad'), the key distortion is Personalization because the speaker assumes fault for the situation. Other distortions like Overgeneralization or Labeling are less supported as the statement is focused on self-blame in response to specific behaviors.",Personalization
3189,"There is indeed a gap between me and him, and if he refuses me, it is also a matter of reason.","""There is indeed a gap between me and him"", ""if he refuses me, it is also a matter of reason""","The statement acknowledges a realistic social or interpersonal gap, which is a neutral observation. The second part rationalizes the potential refusal of 'him' as something reasonable, implying acceptance of his perspective rather than assuming negative intent or projecting emotions onto the situation. There is no evidence of distorted thinking such as catastrophizing, assuming certainty without evidence, or personal blame. Instead, the person is using logical reasoning to explain the situation. Therefore, this reflects a balanced and reasonable thought process rather than a cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

Additionally, the speaker expresses strong belief that 'everything is possible,' which leans more towards optimism rather than distortion. The main distortion evident is the 'should' phrase, which reflects rigid expectations or rules about what is necessary. There is no clear all-or-nothing thinking, magnification, or fortune-telling here, nor emotional reasoning or other distortions.",Should statements
3191,I'm so sorry that I didn't solve the conflict with my kids.,"""I'm so sorry that I didn't solve the conflict with my kids.""","The statement reflects a negative self-assessment tied to a specific event of not resolving a conflict. The speaker feels regret and possibly blame themselves for the unresolved issue. This indicates a distortion where the person is taking personal responsibility for something that may not completely depend on them. There is no indication of absolute terms (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or assuming others’ thoughts (Mind Reading). The focus is on self-blame for the outcome, which aligns with the 'Personalization' distortion where one believes they are the cause of external events unnecessarily.",Personalization
3192,What am I supposed to tell my family? They don't care about company policies. They think it's my problem to lose their pay.,They don't care about company policies. They think it's my problem to lose their pay.,"The speaker assumes knowledge of the family's thoughts and feelings without evidence, implying that the family doesn't care and blames the speaker. This reflects assuming others' mental states or opinions without direct confirmation, which aligns with mind reading. It is not magnification or all-or-nothing since it focuses on presumed thoughts, not extremes or filtering. No statements also do not fit since this is not about obligations. Therefore, the best fitting distortion is mind reading.",Mind Reading
3193,"I've been violated, my life has failed, my life has been ruined.","""I've been violated"", ""my life has failed"", ""my life has been ruined""","The statement presents a very negative and extreme view of the speaker's experiences and overall life. The phrase ""my life has failed"" and ""my life has been ruined"" suggests a sweeping negative conclusion about the entire life based on current or past adverse experiences. This type of thinking reflects a black-and-white perspective with no middle ground, which aligns with the definition of All-or-Nothing Thinking. The individual sees the situation in absolutes: everything is a complete failure and ruined.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3194,I can't help it because I don't take care of my children at work.,"""I can't help it""; ""I don't take care of my children at work""","The key phrase 'I can't help it' suggests a sense of helplessness and inevitability, implying the speaker believes their actions (not taking care of children at work) are unavoidable. This reflects an underlying belief that things must be a certain way, which aligns with 'Should statements'—expectations about how one must or should behave. The statement implies a self-imposed standard or expectation about child care responsibility conflicting with work environment constraints. It is not all-or-nothing, fortune-telling, or labeling; rather, it is the imposition of a 'should' rule leading to guilt or distress.",Should statements
3195,Mom must think I'm too stupid to take care of myself. I let her down.,"""Mom must think I'm too stupid to take care of myself"", ""I let her down""","The statement assumes what Mom is thinking without any explicit evidence, which is a classic example of mind reading. The speaker attributes a negative thought to Mom (thinking they are 'too stupid') without confirmation, interpreting her thoughts negatively. Additionally, the phrase ""I let her down"" shows taking blame personally, but the primary distortion is the assumption about Mom's thoughts, fitting mind reading best.",Mind Reading
3196,"So much work, I'm really done? I'm tired.","""So much work"", ""I'm really done?"", ""I'm tired""","The statement expresses a sense of being overwhelmed and exhausted after a large amount of work. The phrase ""I'm really done?"" and ""I'm tired"" rely on the person's emotional state to conclude that they cannot continue. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where the individual's feelings (tiredness, being overwhelmed) are treated as evidence that they are completely done or unable to continue, rather than based on objective facts.",Emotional Reasoning
3197,It's been a long time since I've been here. He's just trying to fire me.,"""It's been a long time since I've been here."" and ""He's just trying to fire me.""","The statement ""He's just trying to fire me"" assumes the intentions of another person without concrete evidence; this reflects mind reading, where one believes they know what someone else is thinking or planning. The fact that it's been a long time since the speaker has been here does not necessarily imply anything about the other person's intentions, but the speaker jumps to the conclusion about firing without clear proof.",Mind Reading
3198,It's bad luck. I was seen with this ear nail the first time. It's bad luck!,"""It's bad luck"" repeated twice, ""I was seen with this ear nail the first time.""","The key phrase 'It's bad luck' implies a belief that an external event (being seen with this ear nail) causes negative outcomes solely due to luck. The speaker is attributing causality to a superstition without evidence, which aligns with predicting a negative future event (bad luck) based on a current or past event. This reflects 'Fortune-telling,' where one assumes they know the future will be negative based on current circumstances.",Fortune-telling
3199,I don't know what he'll think when he hears it.,"""I don't know what he'll think when he hears it.""","The statement involves making an assumption about another person's thoughts or reactions without concrete evidence.

3200,I'm so depressed. I'm like rotting mud. I can't turn over forever.,"""I'm so depressed"", ""I'm like rotting mud"", ""I can't turn over forever""","The statement includes a highly negative self-label ('rotting mud') and an absolute negative belief about the ability to change ('I can't turn over forever'). This reflects a global negative judgment about the self and a fixed, unchangeable state. The phrase 'I'm like rotting mud' is a direct example of labeling, where the individual assigns a negative and demeaning label to themselves rather than describing a specific behavior or situation. The statement 'I can't turn over forever' further emphasizes a sense of permanence and inability to improve, typical in labeling where the identity is defined by a negative attribute.",Labeling
3201,They get along well. Lucky they don't have to force me to socialize. I prefer to be alone.,"""Lucky they don't have to force me to socialize"", ""I prefer to be alone""","The statement expresses a preference for solitude and interprets the situation as fortunate because others are not forcing social interaction. This reflects a belief or assumption about how things ought to be (that being forced to socialize would be negative). The phrase 'Lucky they don't have to force me' implies a judgment about how social interactions should occur, aligning with an implicit 'should' or 'must' about social behavior—i.e., socializing should not be forced. This matches the 'Should statements' distortion, where individuals have rigid rules about how they or others should behave.",Should statements
3202,It's normal for a child to cheat. Be patient as a teacher.,"""It's normal for a child to cheat""; ""Be patient as a teacher""","The statement ""It's normal for a child to cheat"" implies a generalized rule or expectation, suggesting what 'should' be accepted or tolerated. ""Be patient as a teacher"" is prescriptive advice conditional on this belief. The key cognitive distortion is the use of 'should' or normative statements about behavior or expectations, which aligns with the 'Should statements' distortion. It dictates what is normal or acceptable, implying a standard that must be followed.",Should statements
3203,"I'm a little upset, but it's also possible that someone else accidentally misdirected it, and I'm not very angry when I ask the shopkeeper to pay for it.","I'm a little upset, it's possible someone else accidentally misdirected it, I'm not very angry when I ask the shopkeeper to pay for it","The statement acknowledges a mild negative emotion ('a little upset') but also considers an alternative explanation ('someone else accidentally misdirected it') and describes a controlled emotional response ('not very angry'). This demonstrates a balanced and realistic perspective without jumping to negative conclusions or extreme emotional reactions. There is no evidence of cognitive distortion such as all-or-nothing thinking, personalization, or emotional reasoning. Instead, the statement reflects a nuanced and reasonable appraisal of the situation.",No Distortion
3204,It's hard for me to measure my grades in his heart. He must think I'm nothing.,"""It's hard for me to measure my grades in his heart"", ""He must think I'm nothing""","The statement involves assuming what another person thinks about the speaker without any direct evidence. The phrase ""He must think I'm nothing"" indicates that the speaker is making an inference about another person's thoughts and feelings. This aligns with 'Mind Reading,' a distortion where one believes they know what others are thinking.",Mind Reading
3205,"If I can't get married and have children, I'll live my life for nothing, not even a dog.","""If I can't get married and have children, I'll live my life for nothing, not even a dog.""","The statement implies a black-and-white view of life’s value based solely on marrying and having children. It suggests that if this condition is not met, life is entirely meaningless, without acknowledging any middle ground or other sources of meaning and fulfillment. This illustrates a rigid, absolute way of thinking typical of All-or-Nothing Thinking rather than incremental or nuanced perspectives.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3206,"I will certainly be seen as a fool, and they will laugh at me secretly.","""I will certainly be seen as a fool"", ""they will laugh at me secretly""","The statement involves assuming the thoughts and feelings of others without evidence, specifically that 'they will laugh at me secretly.' This reflects the belief that others have negative opinions about the speaker, which is a clear example of mind reading—a cognitive distortion where one presumes to know what others are thinking. Although there is also a sense of certainty ('certainly be seen as a fool'), the dominant distortion is the assumption about others' private thoughts.",Mind Reading
3207,She's not getting along with me anymore. I'll never meet a relative or a colleague in my life.,"""She's not getting along with me anymore."" and ""I'll never meet a relative or a colleague in my life.""","The first phrase indicates a specific interpersonal conflict. The second phrase extrapolates this single experience into a broad, absolute conclusion about all future social interactions, implying an assumption that because one relationship is strained, none will ever be positive or possible. This reflects a pattern of taking one instance and generalizing it across all relevant contexts. This is characteristic of ""Overgeneralization"" rather than other distortions such as ""Fortune-telling"" (which predicts specific future events) or ""Mind Reading"" (which assumes knowing others' thoughts).",Overgeneralization
3208,I don't think so. I think I look good.,"""I don't think so"", ""I think I look good""","The statement expresses a personal belief that the speaker looks good, which contradicts an assumed negative evaluation that the other person might have implied. There is no evidence of extreme thinking, predictive judgment, or labeling. Instead, it counters a negative thought with a positive self-assessment. This reflects a reasoning based on personal feelings rather than an emotional conclusion unsupported by facts; thus, there's no distortion involved.",No Distortion
3209,"The man who gave me the greatest support left, and I felt like I couldn't live on my own.","The man who gave me the greatest support left, and I felt like I couldn't live on my own.","The statement links the departure of a supportive person directly to the belief that the speaker cannot live independently. This reflects an emotional response ('I felt like') leading to a conclusion about reality ('couldn't live on my own'). The speaker is interpreting their inability to live alone based on their emotional state triggered by the loss, which matches the definition of Emotional Reasoning—using feelings as evidence for truth rather than objective facts.",Emotional Reasoning
3210,Somebody must have hurt Dad.,Somebody must have hurt Dad,"The statement assumes knowledge of what others are doing or have done without direct evidence, implying the speaker believes that someone intentionally hurt Dad.

3211,This society is gifted. It's useless to try.,"""This society is gifted. It's useless to try.""","The phrase ""This society is gifted"" is a form of labeling, as it assigns a trait or characteristic to the entire society. However, the core distortion lies in the phrase ""It's useless to try,"" which suggests a negative prediction about the future without evidence. This is an example of fortune-telling, where the speaker assumes they know the outcome will be negative (trying will be useless). The sentence assumes failure in advance and discourages effort prematurely.",Fortune-telling
3212,"The boss didn't remind me, just to find a reason to fire me.","The boss didn't remind me, just to find a reason to fire me.","The statement assumes the boss's intent without evidence, specifically that the boss deliberately withheld a reminder in order to find a reason to fire the speaker. This involves assuming knowledge of the boss's internal motives, which is not explicitly stated or confirmed. Such an assumption is a classic example of 'Mind Reading,' where one believes they know what others are thinking or intending.",Mind Reading
3213,"No matter which side I refuse, they'll hate me.","""No matter which side I refuse, they'll hate me.""","The speaker assumes that regardless of their choice ('which side I refuse'), others will have a negative emotional response ('they'll hate me').

The phrase 'like I'm stuck in front of a wall that can never be crossed' suggests a perceived permanence to this lack of progress. This aligns with overgeneralization, where one negative event or situation is applied broadly and pessimistically across unrelated areas of life.",Overgeneralization
3215,I didn't think I'd have a tumor. It could be God telling me that my life's in the countdown!,"""It could be God telling me that my life's in the countdown!""","The speaker is predicting a catastrophic future event ('my life's in the countdown') based on the current situation of potentially having a tumor. This is a speculative prediction about the future without concrete evidence, fitting the characteristic of 'Fortune-telling' cognitive distortion.",Fortune-telling
3216,"The second time I talked, my life must be full of pain like this.",my life must be full of pain like this,"The statement assumes a cause-effect scenario based on an internal feeling or experience without objective evidence, concluding that life is characterized by pain because of a single event or moment of talking. This reflects a thought process where an emotional state ('pain') is taken as concrete truth about life’s overall condition, which aligns with the definition of Emotional Reasoning—believing something is true because it feels true emotionally.",Emotional Reasoning

The speaker expresses a need for vigilance, which suggests a moderate self-imposed guideline rather than a rigid 'should' or 'must' statement. There is a positive outlook expressed through confidence in finding a satisfactory job, which counters catastrophic or negative forecasting. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking (no extremes), emotional reasoning (facts stated, not feelings as facts), fortune-telling (positive confidence rather than predicting negative outcomes), labeling (no global negative labels), magnification (no exaggeration of negatives), mental filter (no focus on single negative details), mind reading (no assumption about others' thoughts), overgeneralization (statement is specific), personalization (no self-blame beyond facts), or should statements (while 'must be vigilant' might be close, it is more a motivational statement rather than a rigid 'should' or 'must' cognitive distortion). Overall, the statement is balanced and adaptive.",No Distortion
3218,I'm the one who died. Why can't God take me away? I'm useless.,"""I'm the one who died"", ""Why can't God take me away?"", ""I'm useless.""","The statement contains a self-deprecating conclusion about the person's worth with ""I'm useless."" This reflects a negative global self-label. The phrase ""I'm the one who died"" suggests a magnified focus on their perceived failure or pain, but the key cognitive distortion here is the direct negative labeling of the self without nuance. Emotional reasoning is present but secondary, as the person equates their feeling of despair with an absolute fact. No predictions about the future (fortune-telling) or binary thinking is evident, so 'Labeling' fits best as the individual assigns a harsh, global negative label to themselves.",Labeling
3219,"They fought with me for my own good, and they blamed me for being unsatisfied to my parents.","""They fought with me for my own good""; ""they blamed me for being unsatisfied to my parents.""","The statement reflects a belief that others' negative actions (fighting and blaming) are aimed at the speaker's benefit or as a critique of their attitude towards parents. This suggests the speaker might be interpreting others' intentions without clear evidence, attributing hostile or corrective motives to their actions. The phrase ""they blamed me for being unsatisfied to my parents"" shows an assumption about others' thoughts or judgments. This fits the pattern of Mind Reading, where one assumes they know what others think or feel without confirmation.",Mind Reading
3220,I'm too busy looking for her. It's my fault.,"""It's my fault.""","The statement ""It's my fault"" reflects the individual attributing blame or responsibility for an event or situation to themselves without clear evidence. This is a hallmark of Personalization, where a person assumes responsibility for something that may not be entirely or directly their fault. The phrase ""I'm too busy looking for her"" sets the context but the key cognitive distortion lies in the self-blame expressed in ""It's my fault."" There is no indication of other distortions such as all-or-nothing thinking or mind reading here.",Personalization
3221,"My family and friends are helping me out, but I still feel bad and I can't accept his departure.","My family and friends are helping me out, but I still feel bad and I can't accept his departure.","The statement indicates that despite external positive support (help from family and friends), the person still feels bad and unable to accept the loss. This suggests that they are basing their emotional state on their feelings rather than objective reality. This is a classic example of emotional reasoning, where feelings are interpreted as evidence of truth (feeling bad equals something is wrong or unacceptable). There is no indication of other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking or fortune-telling as the statement is focused on emotional experience and acceptance.",Emotional Reasoning
3222,"Having a disease like this, my life is a burden to others.","Having a disease like this, my life is a burden to others.","The statement assumes that because the person has a disease, their entire life is a burden to others. This generalizes a specific situation (having a disease) to a broad negative conclusion (being a burden in life) without evidence. The person is making a sweeping negative judgment about themselves based on a single aspect, which indicates overgeneralization rather than focusing on only one facet or thinking in absolutes.",Overgeneralization
3223,"I just can't have a lot of money, and I'm destined to be poor and not rich in my life.","""I just can't have a lot of money"", ""I'm destined to be poor and not rich in my life""","The statement involves making a broad conclusion about one's financial future based on a perceived current reality, implying that because they currently don't have much money, they will never be rich.

The feeling is based on emotional perception rather than objective fact, but the main cognitive distortion here is assuming to know what others think/feel (Mind Reading) rather than just feeling it emotionally (which would be Emotional Reasoning). The statement does not reflect an extreme all-or-nothing view, personal blame or should statements. It is the belief about how others feel regarding the self, without concrete proof, thus Mind Reading fits best.",Mind Reading
3228,"I'm always troublesome for my family, and I can't be healthy and happy, even when I'm mentally ill.","""I'm always troublesome for my family"", ""I can't be healthy and happy, even when I'm mentally ill""","The phrase 'I'm always troublesome for my family' shows a broad and absolute negative self-assessment, implying that in every situation the person is a problem for their family. This is indicative of overgeneralization, as 'always' suggests a sweeping conclusion based on limited or specific events. The second part, 'I can't be healthy and happy, even when I'm mentally ill,' reinforces a fixed negative belief about the self's capacity for well-being, but it primarily supports the overgeneralized negative self-view. There is no evidence of emotional reasoning where feelings are taken as facts, nor labeling as it is not a simple label but a broad negative statement. It is not fortune-telling or mind reading, nor is it magnification or mental filter. Therefore, the dominant distortion is overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
3229,He's never been able to talk to me. I never had any respect.,"""He's never been able to talk to me."" ""I never had any respect.""","The speaker uses absolute terms like ""never"" indicating that at no point has the person been able to talk to them or shown respect. This represents a black-and-white view without acknowledging any exceptions or nuances. Such all-encompassing statements where events or characteristics are seen as absolute and unchanging align with the cognitive distortion called All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The phrase ""I won't be happy this day"" suggests the speaker is assuming the entire day will be unhappy without any flexibility. This reflects assuming a complete negative outcome without considering partial or alternative possibilities. This aligns with 'All-or-Nothing Thinking,' where the situation is seen in extremes—either completely ruined or not, with no middle ground.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

""That's why he's making me feel bad.""","The statement assumes knowledge of the child's feelings without direct evidence, specifically that the child dislikes the speaker. This represents 'mind reading,' as the speaker believes they know the child's thoughts or emotions. The second part links the child's behavior to the speaker's feelings, but the primary distortion lies in assuming the child's feelings without proof.",Mind Reading

Maybe we'll have a seat.","The statement anticipates a possible negative outcome (the hotel being full), but rather than assuming the worst or fixating on it, it offers a reasonable alternative (trying the next hotel) and a hopeful possibility (maybe having a seat). There is no evidence of negative prediction without basis or certainty; instead, the speaker shows flexibility and openness to different outcomes.

The phrase ""I'm sure it's driving me crazy"" indicates the use of feelings as facts. Furthermore, the anticipation of needing to play less later suggests a response based on this emotional conclusion. This reflects Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are equated with facts.",Emotional Reasoning

The phrase ""they must've told me I'm low on the back"" indicates assuming what others think without concrete evidence, which is mind reading. However, the core distortion here is the internal negative labeling of oneself as 'so bad,' which fits the definition of Labeling better than Mind Reading, since the judgment ""I'm so bad"" is explicit and central.",Labeling
3236,"If I fail this time, I will never invest in success.","""If I fail this time, I will never invest in success.""","The statement assumes that a single failure will determine all future outcomes, implying an absolute and categorical consequence.

There is no evidence of extreme thinking, blaming, negative labeling, or emotional reasoning. Instead, the speaker is cautiously exploring reasons and solutions without jumping to conclusions or global judgments. The use of ""Maybe"" and proposing an alternative approach indicates balanced and flexible thinking rather than cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

The speaker attributes their perceived shortcomings directly to their innate qualities, which is characteristic of Labeling. Although the statement also implies personal blame and emotional reasoning, the core distortion is the application of a very negative and global label to oneself. This is stronger and more dominant than other possible distortions in the text.",Labeling

All the other kids are better than me.,"""I've always felt bad about myself"", ""All the other kids are better than me""","The speaker generalizes their self-perception by stating they have 'always felt bad about myself,' implying a persistent negative self-view. Additionally, the statement 'All the other kids are better than me' extends this negative view to a broad comparison, suggesting that no exception exists. This reflects a pattern of overgeneralizing one negative feeling or experience to all similar situations or people.",Overgeneralization

However, the speaker explicitly states that although some advice is misaligned, most advice is valuable. This balanced perspective shows no evident distortion such as labeling, magnification, or all-or-nothing thinking. The speaker does not jump to conclusions or make negative assumptions without evidence. Instead, they neutrally evaluate the input and appreciate the value in most of it. Thus, the statement lacks any identifiable cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

Why else would it be so difficult for me?,"""I'm an incompetent loser""; ""Why else would it be so difficult for me?""","The speaker uses a global negative label 'incompetent loser' to describe themselves based on the difficulty they're experiencing. This reflects a tendency to assign a broad negative identity rather than focusing on specific behaviors or situations. The phrase 'Why else would it be so difficult for me?' implies that the difficulty is proof of this negative label. This fits the cognitive distortion of Labeling, where one applies a fixed negative label to oneself.",Labeling
3242,What's wrong with fat and not eating rice from someone else's house? I think the meat is cute too.,"""What's wrong with fat and not eating rice from someone else's house?

The second part, 'I think the meat is cute too,' suggests a positive or affectionate label toward 'meat' (possibly referring to chubby people). There is no evidence of extreme thinking (All-or-Nothing), jumping to conclusions (Fortune-telling, Mind Reading), filtering, personalization, or demanding behavior (Should statements). Instead, the individual challenges a negative label and applies a positive label instead. Since the statement involves applying labels (negative or positive) to people or concepts, the closest distortion here would be 'Labeling,' as the speaker reflects on and seemingly rejects a negative labeling of fatness and instead applies a positive one.",Labeling

3244,"Well, I can't keep my mouth shut. It won't happen again.","""I can't keep my mouth shut"" and ""It won't happen again.""","The phrase ""I can't keep my mouth shut"" reflects a generalized, absolute statement about the speaker's behavior, indicating a tendency to view themselves as wholly incapable in this regard. The phrase ""It won't happen again"" functions as a promise to change, but the core distortion lies in the absolute thinking that they 'can't' do something at all, which aligns with viewing situations in black-or-white terms. This fits the pattern of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where the person sees their ability as either completely present or completely absent.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The phrase ""It's like an idiot"" reflects a negative self-labeling based on the situation. This is an example of Labeling, where the individual assigns a global negative trait ('idiot') to themselves instead of focusing on the specific behavior or situation. Although there's a hint of hopelessness, the dominant distortion here is the negative self-label based on the diagnosis and perceived futility.",Labeling
3246,I should be grateful. My foster parents gave me a second life. How can I face their demands? No.,"""I should be grateful.""","The statement explicitly uses the word 'should,' indicating a rule or expectation the speaker imposes on themselves. The phrase 'My foster parents gave me a second life' provides a reason for feeling grateful, but the conflict arises with 'How can I face their demands? No,' suggesting resistance or difficulty accepting expectations. The primary distortion here is the use of 'should' statements, which create pressure, guilt, or feelings of inadequacy around meeting certain standards or obligations.",Should statements

The speaker links the absence of company/support directly to financial hardship without exaggeration or absolute terms. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or fortune-telling. Instead, the speaker expresses a realistic concern and a desire for help, without distortions like emotional reasoning or mind reading.

This is a conclusion that applies a single adverse outcome to all future social interactions, which is an example of generalizing one event to all possible situations. It is not simply predicting the future without evidence (fortune-telling), but rather extrapolating one circumstance to an absolute and global conclusion. Hence, it fits the concept of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization

The belief that feelings equate reality (I feel like I can't live anymore, so it must be true) reflects Emotional Reasoning. Additionally, predicting that life will collapse without evidence suggests Fortune-telling.

The phrase ""I'm probably the most nervous and lazy person"" reflects a broad, sweeping negative label applied to the self, rather than a balanced view. This suggests the speaker is categorizing themselves in an extreme and all-encompassing way. The uncertainty in ""I don't even know how I did it"" adds to a negative self-view but is less diagnostic. Among the given cognitive distortions, applying harsh, global labels to oneself corresponds best with ""Labeling."" The statement does not show clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking (which involves black-and-white extremes without nuance), emotional reasoning (basing truth on feelings), fortune-telling (predicting negative future), mental filter (focusing only on negative details), mind reading (assuming others’ thoughts), magnification (exaggerating in negatives), overgeneralization (drawing broad conclusions from a single event), personalization (taking blame without cause), or should statements (rigid demands).

This reflects an overextension of current difficulties to all future scenarios without evidence that failure is inevitable. The doubt about maintaining any romantic relationship and destroying anything built generalizes one’s current emotional and situational struggles to all future interpersonal and constructive efforts.

I've been having a bad sleep lately.,"""I really can't keep up with working late""; ""I've been having a bad sleep lately""","The statement ""I really can't keep up with working late"" reflects a belief that the person is unable to manage late working hours. This is based on the recent experience of ""having bad sleep lately,"" which might be causing the difficulty. The thought seems to infer an absolute incapability, without room for variation or improvement, suggesting a rigid, black-and-white perspective.

They then speculate that there is some unknown problem ('something wrong with the other part') without evidence or clear knowledge. This reflects uncertainty and guessing about future or unknown causes. However, the speaker does not express certainty about negative outcomes nor make definite predictions. They end with a neutral statement about seeking advice.

Additionally, the phrase 'Nothing good will ever happen to me' generalizes a negative expectation to all future events, which fits overgeneralization. The statement 'I'm on the edge' reflects distress but does not denote emotional reasoning as a core distortion here. Between the two potential distortions, the primary cognitive distortion is fortune-telling because the speaker is predicting a negative outcome (undesired leadership role) with unwarranted certainty. The overgeneralization phrase supports the negative prediction but is secondary.",Fortune-telling

The phrases suggest a subjective emotional response is being taken as evidence of reality—because they feel overwhelmed and distressed, they conclude that the kid is causing them extreme harm and that their mental state is deteriorating. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are used as proof of an objective truth, rather than recognizing the feelings as subjective responses.",Emotional Reasoning

The concern about the relationship being ""wiped out for weeks"" indicates worry about the state of the relationship but does not necessarily involve other distortions like magnification or all-or-nothing thinking here. The decision to talk on weekends suggests a solution rather than a distortion.

It suggests that because the weight issues began in childhood and were uncontrollable then, the speaker is absolved of responsibility now. This reflects a cognitive distortion where one attributes current issues solely to external factors beyond their control, which aligns with avoiding personal responsibility rather than an objective assessment. The distortion here involves creating a fixed label or identity (being 'fat') that is blamed on past uncontrollable events, which is characteristic of 'Labeling'.",Labeling

3306,"If you are not familiar, do not force yourself, and if you are not interested, it is difficult to conspire.","""If you are not familiar, do not force yourself"" and ""if you are not interested, it is difficult to conspire""","The statement suggests that lacking familiarity or interest makes it difficult to conspire, implying a prediction about future outcomes based on current feelings or knowledge. This is a form of expecting or assuming how things will turn out without concrete evidence. It does not reflect an absolute black-and-white view (ruling out All-or-Nothing), nor does it attribute blame or label anyone negatively. It is not based on emotions as evidence (ruling out Emotional Reasoning), nor does it filter out positive information selectively. The key part is the assumption about difficulty occurring due to current states, which fits with Fortune-telling, predicting a negative outcome based on limited information.",Fortune-telling
3307,I wish I could sew it in. It's embarrassing to say hello to someone.,"""It's embarrassing to say hello to someone.""","The statement reflects the speaker's emotional response to the situation ('embarrassing') and uses that feeling as evidence of reality. Instead of objective evaluation, the speaker judges the act of saying hello as inherently embarrassing based solely on their current emotion. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are equated with facts.",Emotional Reasoning
3308,"No matter what I do, I won't make them happy. It's better not to do it.","""No matter what I do, I won't make them happy. It's better not to do it.""","The statement ""No matter what I do"" suggests a belief that there are no exceptions or alternatives that could lead to a positive outcome. This is indicative of viewing the situation in a binary, absolute way — either complete failure or complete success, with no middle ground. The conclusion that ""it's better not to do it"" follows from this absolutist thinking. This aligns closely with All-or-Nothing Thinking, where situations are perceived in black-or-white terms without recognizing possible nuances or partial successes.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3309,It's too hard to learn a car. I'll never drive this fucking car.,"""It's too hard to learn a car."" ""I'll never drive this fucking car.""","The phrase ""I'll never drive this fucking car"" indicates a definitive and absolute conclusion about the future ability to drive the car, which is a hallmark of fortune-telling. The speaker predicts failure without evidence. While there is an expression of difficulty in learning, the main cognitive distortion lies in assuming a negative and unchangeable outcome (never driving the car) based on current feelings.",Fortune-telling
3310,What else can I do? I'm a complete piece of shit.,"""I'm a complete piece of shit.""","The phrase ""I'm a complete piece of shit"" is a harsh, global negative label directed at the self. Instead of focusing on a specific behavior or situation, the statement applies a broad, derogatory label to the entire person. This fits the definition of Labeling, where one assigns a negative global identity to oneself based on perceived faults.",Labeling
3311,My family is an unfortunate family.,"""My family is an unfortunate family.""","The statement assigns a global negative label to the family as a whole, rather than describing specific incidents or behaviors. It encapsulates the entire family identity in a single, fixed negative descriptor ('unfortunate'). This matches the definition of Labeling, where a person is defined in absolute, often negative terms.",Labeling
3312,I'm the one who doesn't like me. That's why everybody doesn't like me.,"""I'm the one who doesn't like me""; ""That's why everybody doesn't like me""","The statement assumes that because the speaker dislikes themselves, it follows that everyone else also dislikes them. This involves making a negative inference about others' thoughts and feelings without evidence. The speaker is attributing a specific belief or feeling to others (that they dislike the speaker) based solely on their own self-perception. This fits the 'Mind Reading' distortion, as the speaker is presuming to know what others think without verification.",Mind Reading
3313,Why can't I have my own ideas? Why are they even more anxious than I am?,"""Why can't I have my own ideas?"" and ""Why are they even more anxious than I am?""","The first phrase suggests self-doubt about having original ideas, implying a negative judgment about oneself without concrete evidence. The second phrase assumes knowledge of others' emotional states ('they are even more anxious'), which cannot be known for certain. This demonstrates an assumption about others' thoughts or feelings without verification, fitting the definition of 'Mind Reading'. The statements do not reflect absolute thinking, emotional reasoning, or predictions about the future, instead they reflect assumptions about others' mental/emotional states.",Mind Reading
3314,People don't understand each other. Nobody understands me. Fuck you.,"""People don't understand each other."" ""Nobody understands me.""","The statement generalizes a lack of understanding from some people to everyone, indicating a sweeping conclusion without sufficient evidence. The phrase ""Nobody understands me"" is a broad generalization about all people failing to understand the speaker. This goes beyond isolated instances to make a universal assertion, which matches the definition of Overgeneralization. There is also an element of frustration but it doesn't fit other distortion types like Mind Reading (assuming knowledge of others' thoughts) as clearly as Overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
3315,I get up and she sleeps and she's trying to mimic me. She's gonna hate me and want to take everything from me.,"""she's trying to mimic me""; ""She's gonna hate me""; ""want to take everything from me""","The statement assumes the other person's thoughts and intentions without direct evidence, specifically that she hates the speaker and wants to take everything from them. This reflects a belief about what someone else is thinking or feeling (hatred and hostile intent), which fits the definition of Mind Reading, as the speaker is attributing negative intentions to the other person without confirmation.",Mind Reading
3316,"When he was kicked out, the neighbor looked at me and he must have been laughing at me.",the neighbor looked at me and he must have been laughing at me,"The statement assumes the neighbor's thoughts or feelings without any direct evidence. It infers that the neighbor was laughing at the speaker based solely on the look, which is a classic example of mind reading—believing that one knows what others are thinking or feeling without confirmation.",Mind Reading
3317,"My roommate's like the worst person in the world, and everyone else's roommates are so harmonious.","""worst person in the world"", ""everyone else's roommates are so harmonious""","The statement includes an extreme evaluation of the roommate as the 'worst person in the world,' which is an absolute, black-and-white judgment without middle ground. Simultaneously, the speaker generalizes all other roommates as perfectly harmonious, implying a rigid division between two opposing categories. This reflects a cognitive distortion where things are seen in extremes, typical of All-or-Nothing Thinking. Although there is a label in the statement ('worst person'), the crucial element is the extreme black-and-white comparison rather than simply assigning a negative label, which would be Labeling. There is also an overgeneralization element ('everyone else's roommates'), but the key distortion is the rigid, absolute categorization.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3318,"They went to the beach camp to celebrate his birthday on weekends and looked so happy. I haven't been camping at the beach. I'm in a good relationship with him.

Why didn't he call me, he thought I wasn't so good with me, and he must not have taken me as a friend.","The speaker assumes they know the other person's thoughts and feelings without any direct communication: 'he thought I wasn't so good with me' and 'he must not have taken me as a friend.' This is a classic example of mind reading, where the person presumes to understand what another person is thinking or feeling, leading to negative conclusions without evidence.",Mind Reading
3319,"As long as I don't have a talent show, my parents must have been embarrassed and thought I was useless.",my parents must have been embarrassed and thought I was useless,"The statement infers the parents' internal thoughts and feelings without direct evidence, assuming the person can know what others are thinking.

3320,It's so painful to have a cramp and cry for a while. It's so sad.,"""It's so painful to have a cramp and cry for a while. It's so sad.""","The statement expresses a subjective emotional experience ('It's so painful' and 'It's so sad') as evidence of an objective truth about the situation. The speaker is concluding that the situation is definitively painful and sad based on their feelings. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where one assumes that their emotional state reflects reality, rather than separating feelings from facts. There is no evidence of absolute thinking, predicting the future, or labeling, just a reliance on emotional perception.",Emotional Reasoning
3321,I'm so stupid. I'll never get a good grade in my life.,"""I'm so stupid"", ""I'll never get a good grade in my life""","The phrase ""I'm so stupid"" is a global, negative label assigned to oneself based on a specific event or feeling. This matches the distortion type 'Labeling', where a person attributes a negative, broad label to themselves rather than focusing on specific behaviors or situations. Additionally, ""I'll never get a good grade in my life"" is a negative conclusion about the future, which suggests 'Fortune-telling'. However, since the statement starts with a self-label of stupidity and the future prediction is rooted in this negative label, the dominant cognitive distortion is 'Labeling'.",Labeling
3322,"It is difficult for me to speak on this stage, and it is very difficult for me to speak, and it is impossible for me to control it.","""It is difficult for me to speak on this stage"", ""it is very difficult for me to speak"", ""it is impossible for me to control it""","The statement escalates from something being difficult to speak on stage, to very difficult, and finally describes it as impossible to control. This progression shows a tendency to view the situation in extreme terms without middle ground, suggesting an all-or-nothing perspective. The speaker interprets the difficulty as an absolute inability to control the situation, which fits the pattern of All-or-Nothing Thinking rather than other distortions like Magnification (which would be more about exaggeration but not necessarily absolute terms), Emotional Reasoning, or Fortune-telling.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3323,"She's jealous of me looking good, a yellow-faced woman who only knows how to work a day.","""She's jealous of me looking good"", ""a yellow-faced woman who only knows how to work a day""","The statement assumes the woman's feelings and thoughts without explicit evidence, claiming she is jealous. This reflects assuming knowledge of another person's internal state. Additionally, the negative label ""yellow-faced woman who only knows how to work a day"" applies a negative label to the person herself rather than focusing on a specific behavior or situation. While Mind Reading is present, the more prominent distortion is Labeling, as the speaker reduces the woman to a derogatory characterization rather than assessing specific actions or emotions objectively.",Labeling
3324,I'm not fit to learn. My brain is so different from the others.,"""I'm not fit to learn"", ""My brain is so different from the others""","The statement involves a negative global judgment about the self (""not fit to learn"") based on perceived differences (""My brain is so different from the others""). This reflects labeling, where the person assigns a fixed, negative label to themselves instead of viewing the situation more flexibly. The person does not simply express a difficulty but rather defines their entire capability or self-worth based on a characteristic.",Labeling

There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking or emotional reasoning. The phrase ""one day he'll make more progress"" involves predicting a positive future outcome without concrete evidence, which aligns with fortune-telling. There is no labeling, magnification, mental filtering, mind reading, personalization, or use of 'should' statements detected here.",Fortune-telling
3326,There's always a contradiction between man and man. Just put up with one another.,"""There's always a contradiction between man and man.""","The phrase uses the word 'always' to assert that contradictions between people happen universally and without exception. This reflects a generalized conclusion drawn from potentially limited evidence or experiences. The statement implies an overarching pattern that may not account for situations where harmony exists, indicating a tendency to overgeneralize.",Overgeneralization
3327,"I can hardly do anything in my body. It's not lazy, I don't hate you, it's just...",I can hardly do anything in my body.,The statement 'I can hardly do anything in my body' generalizes a sense of incapacity to most or all physical activities without specifying particular situations or exceptions. This reflects an overgeneralization where a single difficulty is extended to a broad conclusion about overall ability.,Overgeneralization
3328,He'll call me back when he's finished talking to me.,"""He'll call me back"", ""when he's finished talking to me""","The statement assumes a specific future outcome regarding someone's behavior (that he will call back), based entirely on the current context (he's talking to the speaker). This reflects predicting a future event without certainty. There is no emotional justification or extreme thinking; rather, it is a prediction about what will happen next based on a current activity.",Fortune-telling
3329,"I don't know what else to do, but I've got to pack up and get ready.","""I don't know what else to do"", ""I've got to pack up and get ready""","The phrase ""I don't know what else to do"" reflects a sense of having no alternative options or solutions available, which indicates a black-and-white or dichotomous thinking pattern. The statement ""I've got to pack up and get ready"" implies a rigid necessity or obligation without consideration of other possibilities. However, the core cognitive distortion here lies in the perceived lack of options, which aligns most closely with All-or-Nothing Thinking, where the person sees the situation in absolute terms—either they do this one thing or there's nothing else left to try.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3330,I'm all alone everywhere. I'm a social loser.,"""I'm all alone everywhere."" ""I'm a social loser.""","The phrase ""I'm all alone everywhere"" suggests a broad conclusion about social isolation in all contexts, indicating a generalization beyond specific instances. The phrase ""I'm a social loser"" applies a negative global label to oneself based on perceived social failures. Together, these indicate a tendency to overgeneralize and to apply a global negative label to oneself. Between the two distortions, 'Labeling' specifically involves assigning a fixed negative identity, which fits the second phrase, while 'Overgeneralization' fits the first phrase describing being alone everywhere. However, since the statement explicitly uses the phrase ""I'm a social loser,"" which is a clear example of labeling oneself negatively, the most fitting cognitive distortion is 'Labeling.'",Labeling
3331,"The law and order in this little place is bad, and the poor place is dirty.","The law and order in this little place is bad, and the poor place is dirty.","The statement makes a negative judgment about the entire area by using absolute terms like 'bad' and 'dirty' without acknowledging any exceptions or nuances. This reflects a broad negative conclusion about the place based on limited observations or feelings, which fits the pattern of Overgeneralization—drawing a general conclusion from a single or few events.",Overgeneralization
3332,"The leadership criticizes me, and I will certainly be fired and then left on the streets and starved to death.","The leadership criticizes me, I will certainly be fired, left on the streets, starved to death","The statement takes a current negative event (criticism) and predicts a catastrophic future outcome (being fired, homeless, starved to death) with absolute certainty. This reflects making a negative prediction without evidence, assuming the worst possible outcome will happen. This pattern matches the cognitive distortion known as Fortune-telling, where one predicts a negative future as if it is certain to happen.",Fortune-telling
3333,He must have said something wrong. It's all my fault.,"""He must have said something wrong."" and ""It's all my fault.""","The phrase ""He must have said something wrong."" reflects an assumption about what another person is thinking or saying without direct evidence, which aligns with 'Mind Reading.' The phrase ""It's all my fault."" indicates the speaker is blaming themselves entirely for the situation, which aligns with 'Personalization.' Between these, the key distortion is the speaker assuming responsibility and blaming themselves completely, which is classic Personalization. The statement does not show evidence of thinking in absolutes (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or labeling. Therefore, Personalization best fits the overall cognitive distortion.",Personalization
3334,It's been criticized. My bad life is as hopeless as this bad job.,"""My bad life is as hopeless as this bad job.""","The statement links the criticism of a job to a general and absolute negative assessment of the speaker's entire life, indicating a broad and sweeping conclusion. This shows an over-extension from one negative event to all aspects of life, which is characteristic of overgeneralization. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking (where only two extremes are considered), emotional reasoning (where feelings are treated as facts), or other distortions. The phrase does not show magnification of one detail but rather a broad negative generalization.",Overgeneralization
3335,The grades are determined by a number of factors. We'll do well next time.,The grades are determined by a number of factors. We'll do well next time.,"The statement acknowledges that grades depend on various factors, which is a balanced and realistic perspective. It also includes an optimistic outlook about doing well next time, which is hopeful rather than distorted. There is no evidence of absolutes, negative labeling, exaggeration, or assuming facts without evidence. Thus, the statement reflects rational thinking without cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

I don't want to be.","""I just have to be myself"", ""don't worry about her"", ""She's more her thing than she is"", ""I don't want to be.""","The speaker is focusing on themselves and distinguishing their identity from another person's ('She's more her thing than she is' implies a judgment or labeling of the other person). There is an implicit negative label applied to the other person, suggesting they are defined by their own traits in a way the speaker dislikes and rejects. This aligns with the cognitive distortion 'Labeling,' as it involves assigning a fixed, negative character or identity to the other person.",Labeling
3337,"My partner's eyes are light, or I'm not good enough, but I have to try harder.","""My partner's eyes are light"", ""I'm not good enough"", ""I have to try harder""","The speaker interprets their partner's eye color (""light"") or behavior as evidence that they themselves are ""not good enough."" This is an example of assuming a negative personal evaluation without objective evidence. The phrase ""I have to try harder"" implies a belief that their worth depends entirely on their effort to meet some implicit standard. This reflects a distorted way of thinking where the person is internalizing the situation as a judgment on their self-worth. The key cognitive distortion here is Personalization, where the individual relates external facts (partner's eye color) to their own perceived inadequacy.",Personalization
3338,That's what happens when I graduate. They won't change. I'll be in hell forever until death.,"""They won't change. I'll be in hell forever until death.""","The statement predicts a negative future outcome ('I'll be in hell forever until death') with certainty, based on the belief that 'They won't change.' This is a clear example of assuming that a negative event will happen without evidence, reflecting a prediction about the future. Hence, this aligns with 'Fortune-telling,' where the individual predicts negative outcomes as inevitable.",Fortune-telling

I won't be able to do anything in the future.","""I haven't even commented on a president"", ""I won't be able to do anything in the future""","The statement moves from a current action (or inaction) to a broad negative prediction about all future capabilities without evidence. The speaker assumes that because they haven't done something specific so far, they will never be able to do anything in the future. This is an example of predicting a negative future outcome (fortune-telling) without basis.",Fortune-telling

3341,I can't go with them anyway. I'd rather be alone.,"""I can't go with them anyway."" and ""I'd rather be alone.""","The statement ""I can't go with them anyway"" suggests a belief that the speaker is incapable or excluded from joining the group, potentially without evidence. This implies a negative conclusion about their social inclusion. The phrase ""I'd rather be alone"" indicates resignation to solitude, possibly as a logical consequence of the first part. The speaker is making a prediction about their social situation and future behavior without clear factual basis. This fits the pattern of fortune-telling, where one predicts negative outcomes or assumes future events will go a certain way without evidence.",Fortune-telling
3342,"I wasn't elected. My life was so dark, it was so boring to be alive.","""I wasn't elected"", ""My life was so dark"", ""it was so boring to be alive""","The statement moves from the specific event of not being elected to a global, negative judgment about the entire life experience ('life was so dark', 'so boring to be alive'). This represents an extreme conclusion based on a single event, implying that life in general is bleak and boring due to this one occurrence. This fits the pattern of overgeneralization, where one negative event is generalized to an overall negative life condition.",Overgeneralization

This is a prediction made without certainty, implying a negative outcome. The phrase 'hoping that it will be happy in heaven' suggests reliance on hope rather than evidence. This fits the characteristic of 'Fortune-telling,' where someone assumes they know what will happen in the future, often negatively.",Fortune-telling

This shows a form of predicting the future based on a current event, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling'. The speaker assumes a specific future outcome without solid evidence. There is no indication of exaggeration (Magnification), categorical thinking (All-or-Nothing), or emotional reasoning. The statement is optimistic but still fits the cognitive distortion of making a definite prediction about the future.",Fortune-telling
3349,Anything bad can happen to me. I'm a dead star.,"""Anything bad can happen to me."" ""I'm a dead star.""","The phrase ""Anything bad can happen to me"" reflects a prediction of negative outcomes without evidence, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling'. The second phrase ""I'm a dead star"" is a negative global self-labeling, applying a harsh, damaging label to oneself, which fits the 'Labeling' distortion. Since the task is to choose one distortion, the stronger cognitive distortion is the self-abusive label, as it encompasses a fixed, negative identity rather than only predicting negative outcomes. Therefore, 'Labeling' is the more prominent distortion here.",Labeling

3351,It's a shame this is happening. My colleagues must have despised me.,"""My colleagues must have despised me""","The statement makes a definitive assumption about what others are thinking without any evidence. The phrase ""must have despised me"" reflects assuming knowledge of others' thoughts, which is characteristic of Mind Reading. There is no clear indication of overgeneralization, all-or-nothing thinking, or other distortions. Therefore, it aligns best with Mind Reading.",Mind Reading

They were such cowards!,"""stubborn old man"", ""knew nothing but to hold me hostage with his old society's thoughts"", ""They were such cowards!""","The speaker uses extreme and absolute terms like 'stubborn old man' and 'knew nothing' which generalize the father's traits in an overly negative light. Additionally, calling 'They were such cowards!' applies a broad negative label to a group. This indicates a global and sweeping negative judgment based on limited evidence, which matches the definition of Labeling—a cognitive distortion where someone assigns a negative, fixed label to themselves or others.",Labeling
3353,Why don't you ask him to join us? Or should he come first? If he wants to meet a new friend.,"""Or should he come first? If he wants to meet a new friend.""","The statement contains the phrase 'should he come first?', which explicitly uses the word 'should' to impose a normative expectation on someone's behavior. This reflects a 'Should statement' cognitive distortion, as it involves an internal rule or demand about how someone ought to act. The rest of the sentence speculates about the other person's desire to meet a new friend, but this does not strongly indicate other distortion types like mind reading or fortune-telling. The key marker is the use of 'should', which aligns with the 'Should statements' category.",Should statements

""I'll cause trouble to others.""","The statement implies a belief that because the person is 'full of bad luck,' they should not go out. This is a prescriptive statement using 'should,' indicating a rule or obligation they feel they must follow. The concern that going out would 'cause trouble to others' reflects a sense of responsibility or obligation influenced by this rule. The primary distortion is the use of 'should' statements, which impose rigid rules or expectations on behavior based on personal beliefs about luck and outcomes.",Should statements
3355,Why are you so nervous when you get to the interview? I'm really a late-stage interview phobia patient.,"""I'm really a late-stage interview phobia patient.""","The speaker labels themselves as a 'late-stage interview phobia patient,' which is a form of labeling, assigning a broad and negative identity based on their nervousness in interviews. This goes beyond describing feelings and assigns a fixed, global label to themselves. The statement is not about predicting the future (no fortune-telling), nor is it an all-or-nothing thinking or should statement. It does not involve emotional reasoning or mind reading either. Hence, labeling fits best.",Labeling
3356,It's the worst thing in the world.,"""It's the worst thing in the world.""","The phrase ""worst thing in the world"" indicates an extreme negative evaluation without considering any middle ground or alternative possibilities.

The phrase 'I can't show a smile' further supports the black-and-white thinking pattern where the individual believes there is no middle ground or partial success. Additionally, 'I must have a migraine' shows an assumption without definitive evidence, which could indicate fortune-telling, but the dominant theme is the rigid and absolute thinking about inability and hopelessness.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

I don't care, I keep looking at me!","""Look at the phone, look at the phone, you're blind, the whole world is blind!""","The statement ""you're blind, the whole world is blind"" generalizes the idea of blindness from one person to everyone universally. This is an example of taking a single situation or trait and applying it broadly without grounds, which reflects overgeneralization. The phrase ""It doesn't matter!"" also reflects a dismissive attitude, but the central cognitive distortion is the sweeping generalization about 'the whole world' being blind.",Overgeneralization
3359,This man is sick. Can't you see? What's the squeeze? She's the owner.,"""This man is sick.""","The phrase ""This man is sick"" is a direct labeling of a person based on perceived characteristics or behavior, assigning a fixed negative trait to him. The rest of the sentence does not contribute to additional cognitive distortions, as it seems unrelated or unclear. Therefore, the key distortion in this statement is assigning a label to a person, which fits the cognitive distortion known as Labeling.",Labeling

3361,It doesn't matter. I have a good life on my own.,"""It doesn't matter"", ""I have a good life on my own.""","The phrase ""It doesn't matter"" suggests dismissing or minimizing a situation or feeling, potentially filtering out other relevant emotions or facts. The statement emphasizes focusing only on the positive aspect ""I have a good life on my own,"" which indicates attention is directed solely toward positive information while ignoring any negatives or complexities. This selective focus on one part of reality while excluding others fits the cognitive distortion of Mental filter.",Mental filter
3362,He didn't answer the phone because he and that guy were hiding something from me.,He didn't answer the phone; he and that guy were hiding something from me.,"The statement assumes knowledge of the other person's motives and intentions without evidence ('hiding something from me'). This implies attributing thoughts or intentions to others without confirmation. The belief about their hidden agenda is a conclusion made about someone else's mental state, which fits the pattern of 'Mind Reading'.",Mind Reading

They'll be disappointed in me.,"The speaker is assuming they know what their parents will think and feel (they will think 'useless child', they won't love anymore, and they will be disappointed). This reflects an assumption of others' mental states without evidence, which is characteristic of mind reading. The statement is predictive and involves speculation about parents' emotions and thoughts, not based on direct knowledge.",Mind Reading

What am I supposed to tell her?""","The phrase ""My dad's such a man"" appears to be assigning a fixed, possibly negative label to the dad, which is a form of labeling. The surprise expressed by ""It's shocking"" indicates a strong emotional reaction potentially reinforcing this label. The following questions ""What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to tell her?"" show uncertainty and distress about how to handle the situation, but that does not indicate fortune-telling or mind reading. The core distortion lies in assigning a broad, defining label to the dad's behavior or personality without nuance. Hence, labeling distortion is the best fit.",Labeling
3365,"There's always someone with no qualities, and I don't think there's any need to be angry at this kind of thing.","""There's always someone with no qualities""","The phrase ""There's always someone with no qualities"" implies a universal statement that applies to all cases without exception, indicating a pattern that is constant and unchanging. This suggests the person is making a broad, sweeping generalization based on limited evidence. The statement also minimizes the need to be angry, but there is no indication of emotional reasoning, mind reading, or other distortions. The key marker here is the use of ""always"" and the categorical nature, which aligns with overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
3366,I'm such a badass. I'm stuck eating ducks.,"""I'm such a badass."" and ""I'm stuck eating ducks.""","The first phrase, ""I'm such a badass,"" is a self-label that assigns a fixed, global trait to the speaker. Labeling involves categorizing oneself in a rigid and often negative or positive manner. Despite the seemingly positive connotation of ""badass,"" it is still a form of labeling, as the speaker is defining themselves through a single phrase that oversimplifies their identity. The second phrase ""I'm stuck eating ducks"" reflects a complaint or frustration but does not contribute to the distortion classification. Therefore, the main distortion is the use of Labeling.",Labeling
3367,"I can't believe all love in the world because of the death of my loved ones, and I began to think that love was fragile and fragile, and that I could not always have love.","""I can't believe all love in the world because of the death of my loved ones"", ""I began to think that love was fragile and fragile"", ""I could not always have love""","The statement generalizes the experience of loss (death of loved ones) to a universal belief that all love in the world is fragile and not permanent. This reflects taking a specific negative event and applying it broadly to all experiences of love. The thinking goes beyond the current facts into a broad, negative conclusion about love itself. This fits with overgeneralization, where one negative experience leads to a sweeping negative conclusion about all similar situations.",Overgeneralization
3368,They'll laugh at me if they know I'm a piece of shit who likes a neighbor!,They'll laugh at me; I'm a piece of shit; who likes a neighbor,"The statement implies that others will definitely laugh at the speaker, reflecting a prediction about other people's thoughts or reactions without evidence. This aligns with 'Mind Reading'—assuming you know what others are thinking. Also, the phrase 'I'm a piece of shit' is a negative label the speaker applies to themselves, but the core distortion here is the prediction about others laughing based on a presumed negative self-judgment. Since the belief about others' thoughts is central, 'Mind Reading' is the most fitting distortion.",Mind Reading
3369,"The fact that I'm being fired means that I'm a complete loser, and my life is like a kite that's been cut off.","I'm being fired means that I'm a complete loser, my life is like a kite that's been cut off","The speaker equates a specific event (being fired) to a global negative self-assessment ('I'm a complete loser'), which is an extreme negative label applied to oneself. This shows the use of a harsh, negative label based on one incident. Additionally, the metaphor 'my life is like a kite that's been cut off' suggests a feeling of hopelessness but is more of an emotional expression rather than the core distortion. The primary distortion here is assigning a negative label to oneself based on a single event, which fits best with the 'Labeling' distortion.",Labeling
3370,I'm tired of being friends with him. It's just a waste of my time.,"""It's just a waste of my time.""","The statement suggests a global negative judgment about the friendship, implying that all interactions with him are unproductive and worthless. This reflects a sweeping conclusion about the entire relationship based on possibly limited experiences or feelings. This kind of broad generalization from specific instances indicates overgeneralization rather than other distortions like labeling or emotional reasoning.",Overgeneralization
3371,It's hard to talk. I'll never learn to be like them.,"""It's hard to talk."" and ""I'll never learn to be like them.""","The phrase ""It's hard to talk"" expresses a current struggle, potentially based on emotional experience. The phrase ""I'll never learn to be like them"" predicts a future outcome with certainty, which implies forecasting without evidence. This is a clear example of Fortune-telling, where the person assumes they know what will happen in the future negatively. It is not All-or-Nothing because the statement is about a future event, not a strict dichotomy; not Emotional Reasoning because the statement is predictive rather than based solely on feelings; no Labeling because there is no name-calling; no Magnification or Mental Filter because the statement is about future inability; not Mind Reading because it does not speculate about others' thoughts; no Overgeneralization as it's about a future event, not a general rule; no Personalization as it is not blaming oneself unfairly; no Should statement since no directive is given.",Fortune-telling
3372,"I can't go to the police, I can't go to the police, I'm sure the cops can't come back.","""I can't go to the police"", ""I'm sure the cops can't come back""","The speaker expresses a strong belief that they are unable to go to the police and that the police will definitely not return. There is a certainty about a negative outcome—assuming what will happen in the future without evidence. This reflects predicting a negative future without factual basis, which matches the definition of Fortune-telling. There is no evidence provided, just an assumption about what will occur, thus it is not All-or-Nothing Thinking or Mind Reading. It also does not involve labeling or emotional reasoning primarily.",Fortune-telling
3373,I'm tired because I don't deserve to be a mother.,"""I'm tired because I don't deserve to be a mother.""","The statement links the feeling of tiredness directly to a belief about not deserving motherhood. The person interprets their emotional state (being tired) as factual evidence for their worthiness or lack thereof. This reflects 'Emotional Reasoning,' where feelings are taken as proof of reality without objective evidence.",Emotional Reasoning
3374,"I've paid so much, I really didn't think it would work. I'll never make it.","""I really didn't think it would work"", ""I'll never make it""","The first phrase shows a negative prediction about the outcome without evidence, which points to expecting failure in the future. The second phrase, ""I'll never make it,"" generalizes the current perceived failure to a definitive statement about all future possibilities. This represents extending one negative instance to an absolute outcome. This is characteristic of Overgeneralization, where a single event is used to make broad negative conclusions.",Overgeneralization
3375,"If this project fails, my life will fail.","""If this project fails, my life will fail.""","The statement implies an extreme either/or scenario where the failure of the project directly results in the failure of the entire life. This reflects a dichotomous thinking pattern without allowance for any middle ground or other outcomes. It does not involve predicting the future with certainty (fortune-telling), blaming oneself personally (personalization), or judging based on emotions or labels. Instead, it simplistically equates one event's failure with total global failure.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This reflects making a definitive negative prediction about the future, which aligns with the distortion of Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
3377,Have you been overworked in the near future? I have to think seriously about the rest of the future.,"""Have you been overworked in the near future? I have to think seriously about the rest of the future.""","The statement involves making a prediction about being overworked in the near future and concerns about what will happen in the future. This reflects a negative anticipation or assumption without evidence. The phrase 'in the near future' and 'think seriously about the rest of the future' indicates forecasting or predicting negative outcomes. This aligns with the cognitive distortion known as 'Fortune-telling,' where one predicts negative events without sufficient evidence.",Fortune-telling
3378,"It feels like everyone wants to control me, like I'm their personal belongings, and I really want to push them all away.","""It feels like everyone wants to control me"", ""like I'm their personal belongings"", ""I really want to push them all away""","The key phrase ""It feels like everyone wants to control me"" indicates the speaker assumes that all people (everyone) have a specific negative intention toward them. This is an overgeneralization from potentially limited experiences to a universal statement about all people. The phrase ""like I'm their personal belongings"" personalizes the situation, but more importantly, the assumption about ""everyone"" wanting control points toward overgeneralizing a negative perception. The feeling of wanting to push everyone away stems from this broad negative conclusion. There is no clear evidence that the speaker is concluding thoughts without evidence (fortune-telling) or attributing thoughts to others (mind reading), rather they are generalizing a belief about all people involved.",Overgeneralization
3379,I'm worried about my daughter. I'll send him a message if something happens.,I'm worried about my daughter. I'll send him a message if something happens.,"The statement expresses worry about a potential future event (something happening to the daughter) and implies a plan to act if that event occurs. There is no definitive prediction about the future but a conditional intent to respond. The speaker is not assuming the event will happen; rather, they are concerned and prepared. This does not fit All-or-Nothing, Labeling, Magnification, or similar distortions. There is no evidence of emotional reasoning or mind reading. The worry implies some anticipation of negative outcomes but not a definitive negative fortune-telling. The phrase 'if something happens' suggests uncertainty, not a firm prediction. Therefore, no cognitive distortion appears clearly present in this statement.",No Distortion
3380,I've been in a lot of pain lately. I'm in a lot of pain.,I've been in a lot of pain lately. I'm in a lot of pain.,"The statement focuses entirely on the presence of pain without any evidence of exaggeration, absolute thinking, or predicting the future. It expresses a feeling based on current experience, suggesting a direct link between feeling pain and the belief about the pain's intensity or persistence. This aligns with emotional reasoning, where an individual concludes something must be true (being in a lot of pain) because they feel it strongly.",Emotional Reasoning
3381,I can't handle an exam. I'm a piece of shit.,"""I can't handle an exam."" and ""I'm a piece of shit.""","The first phrase ""I can't handle an exam"" reflects a negative prediction about the ability to deal with a specific event, which could indicate fortune-telling. However, the second phrase ""I'm a piece of shit"" is a global, negative self-assessment that labels the individual with a harsh, negative term instead of addressing the specific behavior or situation. This is characteristic of Labeling, where a person unfairly assigns a negative label to themselves based on limited evidence. Although there is an element of negative prediction, the focus on self-identity through a derogatory term indicates Labeling more strongly.",Labeling
3382,Why do so many of her friends always have a problem with me? It must have been because she looked at me.,"""so many of her friends always have a problem with me""; ""It must have been because she looked at me""","The first phrase indicates a general conclusion about many people having a problem, which hints at overgeneralization. The second phrase attributes the cause of the problem specifically to a single action (her looking at me) without evidence, implying mind reading—assuming to know others' thoughts or feelings without direct confirmation. Since the speaker assumes the reason for others' negative feelings based on an inferred look, the key distortion is mind reading.",Mind Reading
3383,"I almost pissed him off today, and I should shut up and stop talking.","""I almost pissed him off today""; ""I should shut up and stop talking""","The first part 'I almost pissed him off today' suggests the speaker is assuming negative consequences without certainty, bordering on mind reading or fortune-telling, but it is hedge with 'almost' which reduces certainty. The second part 'I should shut up and stop talking' clearly uses 'should' statements, imposing rigid rules or demands on oneself that can lead to guilt or frustration. Among the possible distortions, the presence of the phrase 'should shut up and stop talking' makes 'Should statements' the best fit, as it signifies self-imposed expectations or rules.",Should statements

The phrase ""It's my fault"" indicates a tendency to personalize events or traits that may not be entirely within personal control. Additionally, calling oneself a ""loser"" is an example of labeling, which involves assigning a negative global label based on specific actions or characteristics. However, since the primary cognitive distortion is the assumption of blame for various unrelated actions, this is indicative of Personalization, where one blames themselves for things beyond their personal responsibility. Although labeling is present, the main distortion revolves around taking fault for various traits and behaviors.",Personalization
3386,This kid's giving me a headache. Maybe the marriage's not right. Let's get a divorce.,"""This kid's giving me a headache."" ""Maybe the marriage's not right."" ""Let's get a divorce.""","The speaker experiences discomfort ('headache') caused by the child and immediately jumps to a broad and drastic conclusion about the marriage's viability without sufficient evidence or exploration of other possibilities. This is an example of making a general conclusion based on a single situation or event (the child's behavior). The thought process shows an overgeneralization from one negative experience to the relationship as a whole, leading to an extreme solution (divorce).",Overgeneralization

He's trying to blind me!,"""My son is trying to hurt me!"", ""Why did he suddenly buy me a smart machine?"", ""He's trying to blind me!""","The speaker assumes malicious intent behind their son's action of buying a smart machine, interpreting it as an attempt to cause harm (to 'hurt' or 'blind'). This is done without evidence and reflects an interpretation of the son's thoughts and intentions. The speaker believes they know what the son is thinking and plans, consistent with assuming negative intentions without sufficient proof. This aligns with the cognitive distortion of 'Mind Reading', where one presumes to know the thoughts or motives of another person.",Mind Reading
3388,"I'm not going out now, I'm not going out any more.","""I'm not going out now, I'm not going out any more.""","The speaker initially refuses to go out at the current moment ('not going out now') and immediately extends this refusal to a permanent state ('not going out any more'). This shift from a specific instance to a broad, absolute conclusion without further evidence demonstrates a form of overgeneralization, where a single event or experience is felt to apply universally and indefinitely.",Overgeneralization

Just hold on, it'll be all right. We'll all get through it, won't we?","The statement acknowledges that pregnancy causes discomfort but normalizes it and reassures that everything will be fine. It does not show extremes in thinking (eliminating All-or-Nothing Thinking), nor does it involve assuming negative future outcomes (eliminating Fortune-telling). There are no negative labels, emotional reasoning based purely on feelings, or personalization. The speaker is expressing hope and optimism that collectively they will manage the situation, which is realistic reassurance. Therefore, no cognitive distortion is present.",No Distortion
3390,I knew there was something going on between me and my family.,"""I knew there was something going on between me and my family""","The phrase ""I knew there was something going on"" implies making an assumption about others' thoughts or feelings without concrete evidence. This suggests the speaker believes they understand what others are thinking or feeling, which aligns with the cognitive distortion of Mind Reading. The statement does not indicate an extreme black-and-white view (All-or-Nothing), nor does it involve predicting the future without evidence (Fortune-telling). It also does not show emotional justification (Emotional Reasoning), labeling, magnification, mental filtering, personalization, or use of 'should' statements. Therefore, the best fit is Mind Reading.",Mind Reading
3391,No wonder they've been so mean to me all these years.,"""No wonder they've been so mean to me all these years.""","The statement implies a conclusion about others' meanness being directly caused by something about the speaker, suggesting the speaker is assuming to understand others' motives without evidence. The phrase 'No wonder' reflects the speaker's interpretation that others have purposely been mean over a long time. This involves assuming knowledge of others' thoughts or reasons (mind reading) rather than focusing on evidence. The distortion is not about all-or-nothing, magnification, or fortune-telling, and it is not generalizing many events but attributing intent or thought to others.",Mind Reading

This reflects the person evaluating the situation based purely on their emotional response rather than objective reasoning, which is characteristic of Emotional Reasoning. The second phrase expresses an absolute desire ('never wanted to get hurt') but is more of a general statement rather than a cognitive distortion like Should statements. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, magnification beyond emotional evaluation, labeling, or personalization.

The second phrase attributes this difficulty to an external agent (God) intentionally causing harm. This reflects taking personal responsibility for something likely beyond one's control and assuming a malicious intent directed at oneself. This matches the distortion called Personalization, where an individual blames themselves or perceives external events as being targeted at them personally without evidence.",Personalization
3394,"I think I spent a lot of time trying, but the result was a little wasted and a little remorseful.","spent a lot of time trying, the result was a little wasted, a little remorseful",The speaker acknowledges their effort but focuses primarily on the negative outcome by describing the result as 'a little wasted' and feeling 'a little remorseful.' This indicates they are filtering out the positive aspects of their effort and concentrating on the negative result. This selective focus on a negative detail while ignoring other positive elements aligns with the Mental filter distortion.,Mental filter
3395,"With the boss, he's just trying to set me up and make me look bad!",he's just trying to set me up and make me look bad,"The statement assumes the boss's intentions without concrete evidence, attributing a negative motive directly to the boss.

The phrase ""He must've had a bad job recently"" and ""he's trying to mess with me"" indicate the speaker is attributing thoughts and motives to someone else. This is an example of making assumptions about what others are thinking or feeling. According to the given distortion types, this fits the ""Mind Reading"" distortion, where one presumes to know another person's mental state or intentions without verification.",Mind Reading
3397,"That's the only way I'm gonna be doing nothing, just living my whole life.","""That's the only way"", ""doing nothing"", ""just living my whole life""","The phrase ""That's the only way"" indicates a rigid either/or perspective, suggesting there are no alternatives to the situation. The speaker assumes that the only possible outcome is ""doing nothing"" and ""just living my whole life"" in a certain way, which reflects an extreme, black-and-white way of thinking without any middle ground or nuance. This aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking, where situations are seen as all good or all bad, with no shades of gray.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

3399,My husband and I were separated from each other and must have lived in pain every day since then.,"""must have lived in pain every day since then""","The statement assumes, without definitive evidence, that both the speaker and their husband have been living in pain continuously since the separation. This is a prediction about an ongoing emotional state based on the current or past event, essentially forecasting negative outcomes about the future without certainty. This aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Fortune-telling, where one predicts that things will be bad without proof.",Fortune-telling
3400,"The hard choices make me a little confused, and my problems are a little hard to solve.","The hard choices make me a little confused, and my problems are a little hard to solve.","The statement acknowledges difficulty and some confusion but does not categorize the situation in absolute terms (no all-or-nothing language). It does not predict the future (no fortune-telling), nor does it assign a generalized label to self (no labeling). The phrase 'a little hard to solve' indicates an acknowledgment of challenge without exaggeration (so not magnification). The speaker is using feelings of confusion as a basis for describing the problem indirectly, but not directly equating feelings with facts, so this is not emotional reasoning. The statement also does not filter out positive aspects, read others' minds, make personalized blame, or use 'should' statements. Overall, the sentence realistically accepts some difficulty without cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

This is a broad negative judgment about their worthiness, seemingly drawn from limited information but generalized to all similar situations. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing extremes, emotional feelings dictating truth, predicting the future, or labeling others specifically. Instead, the key issue is the broad conclusion generalized from specific instances, which fits the definition of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
3402,"I heard my real father was a businessman, but he was cold, and even his own children would be abandoned.","""he was cold"", ""even his own children would be abandoned""",The statement generalizes the father's coldness and the claim that he 'abandoned even his own children' based on the information heard. This reflects a broad negative conclusion about the father's character and actions that may not be supported by all available evidence. The phrase 'even his own children would be abandoned' implies a sweeping generalization about his behavior toward all his children.,Overgeneralization

It involves predicting or assuming facts about the person's life based on perception, which is a hallmark of 'fortune-telling'. The other phrases describe smoothness and experience but do not represent cognitive distortions on their own. The key distortion lies in assuming unverified personal details about the person.",Fortune-telling
3404,Is it possible that my colleagues don't want to come near me because of my stutter?,my colleagues don't want to come near me because of my stutter,"The statement involves assuming the thoughts or feelings of others (colleagues) without concrete evidence, specifically that they avoid the speaker due to their stutter. This reflects a belief about others' internal states without confirmation, which aligns with 'Mind Reading'. The speaker is predicting negative intentions from others based on their perception, fitting the definition of mind reading rather than fortune-telling (which is predicting future events), personalization, or other distortions.",Mind Reading

There is no absolute thinking, no assumption about feelings as facts, no prediction of future events, no negative labeling, no exaggeration, no selective focus, and no mind reading.

The phrase ""The future looks like a cloudy sky to me"" shows a negative prediction about the future without evidence, indicating the person is predicting a negative outcome. This aligns with 'Fortune-telling', where one expects a negative future without sufficient basis. While there is some emotional expression, 'Emotional Reasoning' would involve assuming something is true because of how one feels, but here the focus is on predicting the future negatively.

The use of ""Must"" indicates a fixed rule or demand on the situation and on others' actions, which is characteristic of 'Should statements'. This is a cognitive distortion where the person imposes strict rules or expectations on themselves or others and feels upset when these are not met. The distress about not being able to eat together or go further supports the frustration stemming from unmet 'should' expectations.",Should statements

Family all over the world!,"The phrase 'Every day' indicates a recurring pattern without exception, and 'Family all over the world!' suggests that the speaker believes this behavior happens from family members everywhere. This reflects an overgeneralization where one negative experience is expanded to a broad, global scale. There is no indication of distorted emotional feelings alone, nor specific assumptions about thoughts or labeling. The key cognitive distortion is extending a limited negative event to all instances or people universally.",Overgeneralization

The phrase 'I can't get into it if I can't' shows a rigid, black-and-white mindset—either fully in or not at all—demonstrating an all-or-nothing perspective. Additionally, the person concludes that it is 'not worth it' and relies on other friends, reinforcing a dichotomous interpretation rather than a more nuanced view. There is no evidence of predicting the future beyond the current situation (no fortune-telling), nor is there emotional reasoning or labeling.

The phrase ""I'm not my turn when it's a good thing"" implies feelings of exclusion or being left out in positive situations, but the central distortion lies in the self-condemning label. This goes beyond acknowledging a mistake or fault and is an internalized, negative label that defines the person's entire identity.",Labeling

This is a classic example of fortune-telling, where one assumes a negative future event will occur. Despite the worry, the person chooses to try it, indicating awareness of the possibility but still proceeding. Emotional reasoning would involve concluding something based purely on feelings, but here the focus is on predicting failure. There is no all-or-nothing or labeling language, nor magnification of an event; it's a clear case of anticipating a negative event in the future without proof.",Fortune-telling

What can I do when I'm such a coward?,"""I'm so sad"", ""What can I do when I'm such a coward?""","The statement includes the phrase ""I'm such a coward,"" which is a negative global label applied to oneself. This is not simply expressing sadness or a temporary emotional state; the speaker is defining themselves in a fixed, negative way. The thought reflects labeling because it assigns a broad, derogatory identity based on feelings or behavior. It is not all-or-nothing thinking because it doesn't present an absolute good/bad dichotomy about situations, nor is it emotional reasoning since the sadness is explicitly stated, not used as proof of truth. There is no predictive element for future events (fortune-telling), no selective focus on negative details (mental filter), and no use of 'should' statements. Therefore, the most appropriate distortion here is Labeling.",Labeling

These labels attribute extreme and definitive traits to the self without nuance. This strongly aligns with the cognitive distortion of Labeling, where a person assigns a global, often negative or exaggerated, label to themselves. Despite some seemingly positive self-labeling ('most successful man'), the overall approach fits Labeling more than other distortions because it focuses on attaching definitive identities rather than predicting outcomes (Fortune-telling), using absolute terms (All-or-Nothing), or other types.",Labeling

This indicates a 'Should statement' cognitive distortion, where the person imposes strict rules on themselves. The phrase ""It's so annoying"" is an emotional reaction but does not itself classify the distortion. The core distortion lies in the self-directed 'should' statement.",Should statements

However, the speaker immediately counters a potentially catastrophic interpretation (drowning) with a more rational, calm assessment (ability to swim back to shore). This indicates the speaker is not catastrophizing or magnifying the problem. Rather, they are using evidence and logic to reduce emotional impact. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or fortune-telling. Emotional reasoning might be present initially, but is balanced and corrected.

This reflects a rigid rule or expectation about existence and worth based on 'should' statements. Although there is self-labeling ('a child like me'), the central distortion stems from the 'should' indicating how the speaker thinks things must be, rather than simply labeling themselves.

The phrase 'Every time' and 'forever' implies a generalization beyond the current evidence, indicating that because there have been failures in the past, the person believes failure will always happen. This is a classic example of overgeneralization, where one or few events lead to a broad, negative conclusion about oneself.",Overgeneralization

The phrase 'a lot of bad luck lately' suggests the person is generalizing specific instances of bad outcomes to an overarching theme or trend, indicating a global negative pattern. The addition of 'I've had another one today' reinforces the notion that the negative experiences are ongoing. This is characteristic of overgeneralization, where a few instances are taken to represent a broad, enduring pattern.",Overgeneralization
3433,I'll be laughed at. I can't keep my mouth shut.,"""I'll be laughed at"", ""I can't keep my mouth shut""","The phrase ""I'll be laughed at"" indicates a prediction about a negative event happening in the future without evidence, which aligns with Fortune-telling. Additionally, the phrase ""I can't keep my mouth shut"" is a statement of perceived inability that supports the prediction. There is no generalization across multiple events, no labeling of self or others, nor is the statement a black-and-white or emotional reasoning conclusion.

This suggests the speaker is taking personal responsibility for an event that is likely outside their control. Additionally, there is a judgment or label about the other person's being 'not a sport,' which seems to contribute to this reasoning. The distortion involves assuming responsibility unnecessarily for an external event, which aligns with Personalization rather than other categories like Mind Reading or Fortune-telling.",Personalization

The use of 'always' suggests that this thought is persistent and unchanging, reflecting a polarized or black-and-white thinking style. This eliminates more nuanced or situational interpretations. The phrase also implies a sense of being unfairly judged or rejected. Among the cognitive distortions, such sweeping generalizations based on perceived repeated behavior fit the category of Overgeneralization. However, it is also close to Mind Reading, where the speaker assumes to know the thoughts of the parents without explicit evidence. Yet, 'always' points more to an overgeneralized statement rather than simply guessing thoughts.

This indicates the speaker is blaming themselves for the event based on their actions or presence, which aligns with the definition of Personalization—taking undue responsibility for negative events outside one's control.

The phrase ""Kids are messing with my class"" shows a negative emotional appraisal of the situation. The question ""Why don't you leave them to rest?"" implies an emotional demand based on that feeling.

The use of the word 'depravity' suggests a harsh negative judgment or labeling of one's own or others' behavior. The speaker is assigning a negative trait to themselves or the situation, which aligns with the concept of 'Labeling'—where a person assigns a fixed, global negative label to themselves or others based on specific behaviors or feelings.",Labeling

I'm a little upset about her.,"The speaker expresses disagreement with Mom's point of view and emphasizes their own independence in thinking, highlighting a distinction between themselves and Mom. The upset feeling indicates an emotional response. However, there is no evidence of extreme or black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), predictions about the future (Fortune-telling), or assuming knowledge of Mom's thoughts (Mind Reading). The statement does not include generalizing one instance to all cases (Overgeneralization), nor does it apply broad negative labels. The speaker is not blaming themselves (Personalization) or using demanding language based on rules (Should statements). The main distortion appears to be interpreting feelings as facts: the upset feeling is used to justify the stance against Mom's perspective, reflecting Emotional Reasoning.",Emotional Reasoning

The statement ""They're so busy all day"" implies the speaker assumes or infers the mental state and busyness of others without direct evidence, which aligns with 'Mind Reading.'

""I must be a pain in the ass, so the teacher can get a chance at me.""","The speaker assumes that the reason the teacher is mad at them is because the teacher was scolded earlier and is taking it out on them. This represents taking responsibility for something that may not be their fault (the teacher's bad mood) and interpreting the teacher's behavior as a personal attack.

It implies that non-existence would eliminate worry, suggesting a belief that current negative feelings are directly caused by being born. This reflects a negative mental filter focused solely on the existence-related worry and may also indicate some emotional reasoning by assuming feelings stem entirely from their birth. However, the core cognitive distortion here is that the speaker overgeneralizes the connection between their existence and their emotional state, implying permanence and inevitability of this worry if born.",Overgeneralization
3523,It's just going out. What's going on? Can't this door just let me out?,"""What's going on? Can't this door just let me out?""","The speaker is attributing intentionality or a deliberate reason behind the door not opening, implying that the door 'should' let them out. This reflects an expectation or demand that things must be a certain way, which is characteristic of 'Should statements'. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or other distortions in this sentence. The focus is on an expectation that the door should permit exit, which aligns best with 'Should statements'.",Should statements
3524,The rest of the neighborhood absolutely despises me and thinks I'm so useless that I can't even get along with my husband.,The rest of the neighborhood absolutely despises me; thinks I'm so useless; can't even get along with my husband,"The statement assumes that the entire neighborhood has a unanimous negative opinion ('absolutely despises me') without concrete evidence, and attributes a broad negative label ('useless') to oneself. This is an example of 'Mind Reading' because it involves assuming others' thoughts and feelings without verification. It is also somewhat 'Labeling' oneself negatively. However, the key distortion is the assumption of knowing others' thoughts, fitting 'Mind Reading' best.",Mind Reading
3525,"I'm sick and tired of what happened at the end of the term, and now the competition is so intense that no other schoolmate wants me to lose my grades, and I'm happy to see my bad luck.","""the competition is so intense that no other schoolmate wants me to lose my grades"", ""I'm happy to see my bad luck""","The statement implies a belief about what other schoolmates want, specifically that they do not want the speaker to lose their grades. This is a presumption about others' thoughts or intentions without evidence, which corresponds to 'Mind Reading'. Additionally, the speaker expresses being 'happy to see my bad luck,' which might reflect emotional reasoning, but the primary distortion is the assumption about others' feelings. Therefore, the key distortion is the assumption about others' thoughts.",Mind Reading
3526,I wanted to have a good meal. I felt like I'd been in a good mood all day.,"""I wanted to have a good meal"", ""I felt like I'd been in a good mood all day""","The statement expresses a desire for a good meal and an observation of feeling in a good mood all day. There is no negative interpretation or cognitive distortion present. The speaker is simply stating their wish and reporting their emotional state without exaggeration, negative filter, or assumptions. There is no evidence of distorted thinking such as jumping to conclusions, labeling, or magnifying faults.",No Distortion
3527,"Without a monetary subsidy, I may not survive, and I do not know why I continue to live.","""Without a monetary subsidy, I may not survive"" and ""I do not know why I continue to live""","The statement assumes a dire consequence (may not survive) dependent on a single condition (monetary subsidy), indicating a catastrophic outlook. The speaker's uncertainty about continuing to live conveys a deep emotional impact, suggesting the current feeling is influencing their perception of reality. The key distortion here is Emotional Reasoning, where feelings of despair lead the person to conclude a negative survival outcome without objective evidence supporting that absolute conclusion.",Emotional Reasoning
3528,"Is he so mean that he can say it in front of me, and he must have said it in the back.","""he can say it in front of me""; ""he must have said it in the back""","The statement assumes knowledge of what the other person said behind the speaker's back without any evidence, inferring thoughts or actions of others. This aligns with 'Mind Reading' because the speaker believes they know the intentions or behavior (saying something behind their back) without factual confirmation.",Mind Reading
3529,"Feels like I can't do it right: even if I know I'm right about something, nobody listens, they ignore me. It feels like everybody thinks I'm an idiot that can't be right.","""Feels like I can't do it right"", ""even if I know I'm right about something, nobody listens, they ignore me"", ""It feels like everybody thinks I'm an idiot that can't be right""","The statement shows the person assuming others think negatively about them without concrete evidence, specifically believing that 'everybody thinks I'm an idiot' and that 'nobody listens.' This involves attributing thoughts or opinions to others without verification. Although there is a feeling or assumption about how others perceive them, there is no objective proof provided. This is characteristic of 'Mind Reading,' where one assumes knowledge of others' thoughts.",Mind Reading
3530,It's awful. I'll never be alone again. My cell phone's dead.,"""It's awful"", ""I'll never be alone again"", ""My cell phone's dead""","The phrase ""It's awful"" reflects an immediate negative emotional response, which could indicate emotional reasoning. However, the key phrase ""I'll never be alone again"" is a sweeping conclusion about the future based on a single situation (cell phone being dead). This is forecasting a future event with certainty, which points to fortune-telling. The phrase ""My cell phone's dead"" is a fact, but it is linked to the negative prediction. Among the options, the prominent distortion is forecasting an inevitable future negative event without evidence (never being alone again due to the phone being dead), which is clearly fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
3531,"It's just a cookie, and I can make up for this little problem by reducing my diet tomorrow.","""It's just a cookie"", ""I can make up for this little problem by reducing my diet tomorrow""","The phrase ""It's just a cookie"" minimizes the significance of eating the cookie, suggesting it is not a big deal, which counters magnifying the problem. The second phrase ""I can make up for this little problem by reducing my diet tomorrow"" shows an attempt to rationalize or compensate for the behavior, indicating a balanced and flexible mindset rather than all-or-nothing thinking or overgeneralization. There is no evidence of catastrophic thinking (Fortune-telling), or negative labeling. Instead, the statement reinforces a balanced perspective without exaggeration or personal blame and lacks any harsh demand or 'should' phrase.",No Distortion
3532,I was wondering why I didn't make it before she died.,"""I didn't make it before she died""","The statement reflects self-blame and assumes personal responsibility for an event that likely was beyond the speaker's control. The focus is on the speaker's role in the timing of an event (her death), implying that the speaker feels responsible for not being there sooner. This fits the distortion of Personalization, where one attributes external events to oneself without sufficient justification.",Personalization
3533,I can't be compared to stress if I'm motivated.,"""I can't be compared to stress"" and ""if I'm motivated""","The statement suggests that because the speaker is motivated, they cannot be affected by or considered as experiencing stress. This is a black-and-white view that excludes any middle ground—either motivated and not stressed at all, or presumably not motivated and stressed. It reflects an absolute way of thinking without acknowledging the possibility of being both motivated and stressed simultaneously.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This reflects the belief that others judge them negatively. This is a classic case of 'Mind Reading,' where the person presumes to know what others think of them without confirmation. The statement does not suggest all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, or labeling in the strict sense because it is focused on others' thoughts rather than self-label or extreme categories. It is not magnification or mental filter as it does not exaggerate or focus on a single negative detail alone. Thus, the best fit is 'Mind Reading.'",Mind Reading
3535,I'm insane! I've ruined my whole life! I've been insane! I'm not a normal person!,"""I'm insane! I've ruined my whole life! I've been insane! I'm not a normal person!""","The speaker uses extreme and definitive labels about themselves, such as 'insane' and 'not a normal person,' which are global, negative labels. They also generalize their experience to 'ruined my whole life,' implying a total negative outcome from their actions or state. This indicates they are labeling themselves in a negative, absolute way, rather than looking at specific behaviors or events.",Labeling
3536,How come no one else can sleep but I can't sleep and I can't sleep?,"""no one else can sleep but I can't sleep and I can't sleep""","The statement compares the speaker's inability to sleep with others' ability to sleep, implying a unique problem for the speaker. The repetition emphasizes this perceived difference. This reflects the distortion where one assumes that others are doing better or have no issues, without evidence. It focuses on interpreting others' states or feelings. This fits the Mind Reading distortion, where the speaker believes or assumes something about others' experiences without concrete evidence, rather than acknowledging the possibility that others may also have difficulties or that the situation is not unique.",Mind Reading
3537,I don't care if I don't listen.,I don't care if I don't listen,"The statement expresses a disregard for the consequences of not listening, which implies an emotional stance rather than a logical one. It reflects 'Emotional Reasoning' because the speaker is justifying a behavior based on their feelings ('I don't care'), rather than concrete evidence or rational assessment.",Emotional Reasoning
3538,"The coaches said that they shouldn't waste too much time in the community, that they didn't pass the exam, that they didn't give it to anyone, and that they should focus on learning later.","""they shouldn't waste too much time"", ""they didn't pass the exam"", ""they didn't give it to anyone"", ""they should focus on learning later""","The statement includes phrases like ""they shouldn't waste too much time"" and ""they should focus on learning later,"" which are prescriptive and indicate what 'should' be done. This reflects the use of 'should' statements, a cognitive distortion where rigid rules and expectations are imposed, often leading to guilt or frustration when not met. The other parts of the statement (not passing the exam, not giving it to anyone) are factual or descriptive but do not indicate other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking or mind reading. Therefore, the dominant distortion is the presence of 'should' statements.",Should statements
3539,No one needs them. I'm just a liability. I shouldn't exist.,"""No one needs them"", ""I'm just a liability"", ""I shouldn't exist""","The speaker generalizes that nobody needs 'them' (likely themselves or someone related), implying a universal negative judgment without evidence. The phrase 'I'm just a liability' labels themselves in a wholly negative way, while 'I shouldn't exist' intensifies this self-condemnation. This reflects an overgeneralization where one negative aspect or feeling is extended to an overarching belief about their worth or existence.",Overgeneralization
3540,I can't bring the money home. I'm sorry about my family. I'm so useless.,"""I can't bring the money home"", ""I'm sorry about my family"", ""I'm so useless""","The key phrase 'I'm so useless' is a direct negative label the speaker places on themselves based on their perceived failure to bring money home. This is a broad and global judgment of self-worth rather than a specific thought about a situation. The statement does not just describe a behavior or feeling but assigns a negative identity. This aligns with the cognitive distortion known as 'Labeling', where one attaches a demeaning and generalized label to themselves instead of describing specific actions or events.",Labeling
3541,"When a man eats a grain of groceries, he is not sick. If he is sick, he will suffer, and he will be cured.","""When a man eats a grain of groceries, he is not sick. If he is sick, he will suffer, and he will be cured.""","The statement sets a rigid cause-and-effect relationship between actions and outcomes: eating grain means not being sick, and being sick necessarily means suffering followed by a cure. It implies an absolute distinction without acknowledging shades of gray or exceptions. This rigid, black-and-white thinking fits the definition of 'All-or-Nothing Thinking,' as it ignores any middle ground such as partial health issues or varying outcomes of sickness.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

They just want to have sex with me and then leave me and turn to the next mentally unstable single mother.,"""Many men don't really care about me"", ""They just want to have sex with me and then leave me"", ""turn to the next mentally unstable single mother""","The statement generalizes a belief about 'many men' as a group, attributing negative motives and behaviors to all or most men without sufficient evidence. This indicates a broad, sweeping conclusion based on limited or subjective experience. The person is making a generalized claim about a large group based on negative interactions, which fits the definition of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
3543,"I can't even learn, and I feel like my life is a tragedy that portends the future of failure.","""I can't even learn"", ""my life is a tragedy"", ""that portends the future of failure""","The phrase ""I can't even learn"" demonstrates a negative self-assessment that could indicate a feeling of helplessness. The description of life as a ""tragedy"" personalizes a negative event or feeling as a defining characteristic. The statement ""that portends the future of failure"" explicitly predicts a negative outcome in the future without concrete evidence, which aligns with the distortion of fortune-telling. While there is some emotional reasoning and labeling present, the anticipation of future failure based solely on current feelings is the most prominent cognitive distortion here.",Fortune-telling
3544,"Now I'm the only one at work, and I don't know what to do next.","Now I'm the only one at work, and I don't know what to do next.","The statement emphasizes being the sole person present at work and the resulting uncertainty on what to do next. There is no evidence of extreme black-and-white thinking (All-or-Nothing), prediction about the future (Fortune-telling), assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading), or labeling oneself or others. The focus is on the immediate situation and the feeling of uncertainty without assuming additional negative outcomes or personal fault. This suggests the speaker is observing a situation realistically without adding cognitive distortions. Thus, this statement appears free from any cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
3545,"Mom and Dad often turn a blind eye to my needs, and I... why should I live in a family like this?",Mom and Dad often turn a blind eye to my needs; why should I live in a family like this?,"The statement generalizes the parents' behavior as consistently neglectful ('often turn a blind eye') and uses this broad negative view to question the validity of living in the family ('why should I live in a family like this?'). This indicates a pattern where one or a few instances are extended to a universal judgment about the whole family and existence within it, characteristic of overgeneralization.",Overgeneralization
3546,"That's what marriage looks like, and it ends up marrying people who don't like it.","""That's what marriage looks like"", ""it ends up marrying people who don't like it""","The statement generalizes the idea of marriage based on a perceived outcome—that marriage inherently results in pairing people who dislike it. This is taking one scenario or perceived truth and applying it broadly to all instances of marriage, which exemplifies overgeneralization. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking (no extremes here), emotional reasoning (no feelings-based logic), fortune-telling (specific future prediction), labeling (no specific name-calling), magnification (no exaggeration expressed), mental filter (no focus on negative detail excluding positives), mind reading (no assumption about others' thoughts), personalization (not relating it to the speaker personally), or should statements (no prescription or demands).",Overgeneralization
3547,Something's wrong with it. That's why they don't want to go out with me.,"""Something's wrong with it.""; ""That's why they don't want to go out with me.""","The speaker assumes there is something inherently flawed about themselves ('Something's wrong with it') as the reason others avoid going out with them. This reflects an assumption about others' thoughts and feelings without concrete evidence. They are inferring what others are thinking ('they don't want to go out with me') based on their own interpretation. This matches the distortion type of Mind Reading, where one believes they know what others think or feel without verification.",Mind Reading
3548,I can work out a different way.,I can work out a different way.,"The statement expresses a positive belief in the ability to find an alternative solution, which does not demonstrate any cognitive distortion. It neither reflects all-or-nothing thinking, jumping to conclusions, nor any form of negative self-labeling or emotional bias. Instead, it shows flexibility and problem-solving mindset.",No Distortion
3549,I don't even have a home. I don't have anything. My life is over.,"""I don't even have a home."", ""I don't have anything."", ""My life is over.""","The speaker is making a sweeping negative conclusion based on their current situation, implying that because they lack a home and possessions, their entire life is effectively over. This indicates a broad generalization from specific negative events to an overall negative judgment about their life. This is characteristic of overgeneralization, where one negative experience leads to a global negative conclusion.",Overgeneralization
3550,I don't know how to resolve this contradiction. I'm afraid our friendship will end here.,"""I'm afraid our friendship will end here.""","The statement expresses a fear or prediction about the future—specifically, that the friendship will definitely end—without evidence. This involves assuming a negative outcome will happen, which matches the definition of Fortune-telling, where one predicts a negative future event.",Fortune-telling
3551,I pissed her off. I must have done something wrong. I should have paid more attention to my behavior.,"""I must have done something wrong."" ""I should have paid more attention to my behavior.""","The speaker is using ""should have"" statements indicating what they believe they ought to have done differently. This typically reflects an internal standard or rule about how they should behave. The phrases portray self-critical expectations, which is characteristic of the 'Should statements' cognitive distortion. Other distortions like personalization or mind reading are present but less dominant, as the key feature here is the use of 'should have' constructions focusing on personal obligation or fault.",Should statements

The phrase ""I can't take care of things like getting married and having children on my own"" reflects a fixed, absolute inability. The phrase ""I don't deserve to be an independent person"" is a harsh negative evaluation or labeling of the self. The phrase ""I have to have a life of domination"" indicates should/must thinking, imposing a strict necessity on how life must be lived. Among these, the central theme is a strict dichotomy of self-worth and capability (either completely unable and undeserving or forced to live dominated), which aligns most closely with 'All-or-Nothing Thinking'—viewing situations, abilities, and worth in black-and-white terms without middle ground. While there are elements of labeling and should statements, the overriding pattern is the absolute, rigid thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

No, I can't die.","""How could I die because of it?"", ""I haven't been to the Bean concert yet."", ""No, I can't die.""","The statement shows a refusal to accept the possibility of death because of the belief that the person has an important experience (going to the Bean concert) still ahead. This reflects a distorted way of reasoning where the reality of death is denied based on a desired future event, indicating denial and a refusal to consider negative outcomes realistically. The person is predicting an outcome (death) won't happen because it conflicts with their personal plans or desires. This aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Fortune-telling, where one predictively assumes or denies certain outcomes without evidence.",Fortune-telling
3554,I can't even do overtime. I'd rather just lie at home and die.,"""I can't even do overtime."" and ""I'd rather just lie at home and die.""","The statement implies a rigid, extreme response to a single situation (not being able to do overtime), leading to a catastrophic conclusion (preferring to lie at home and die). This reflects an all-or-nothing mindset, where the person sees the situation in black-and-white terms without recognizing any middle ground or alternative outcomes. There is no evidence of predicting the future (fortune-telling), accusing others' thoughts (mind reading), or applying a label. The reasoning is based on an absolute, extreme viewpoint typical of All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

They assume full blame for the outcome ('a responsibility that falls entirely on me') which is characteristic of Personalization distortion. Additionally, the phrase 'because I deserve it' implies a sense of self-blame or self-punishment. Other distortions like All-or-Nothing or Should Statements are less fitting because the focus is not on absolutes or rules, but on attributing personal fault exclusively.",Personalization
3556,I'm devastated. I have so much work to do. Why me?,"""I'm devastated"", ""I have so much work to do"", ""Why me?""","The statement expresses an intense negative emotion ('I'm devastated') which is used as evidence that the situation is overwhelming, reflecting Emotional Reasoning. The phrase 'Why me?' implies a sense of being singled out or unfairly burdened, which often accompanies Emotional Reasoning as the feeling dictates the perception of reality. There is no indication of extreme dichotomous thinking (All-or-Nothing), predicting the future negatively (Fortune-telling), or other distortions like Labeling or Mind Reading.",Emotional Reasoning

""How else would they get so many people to know it's in my ear?""","The speaker assumes knowledge of others' communication ('they don't talk well') to explain how many people came to know a personal detail. This reflects a belief that others have intentional or specific negative traits or behaviors based on an interpretation without evidence. The statement implies that the speaker attributes the spread of information solely to others' poor communication rather than other possibilities. This fits the cognitive distortion of Mind Reading, where one assumes they know others' thoughts or intentions without proof.",Mind Reading
3558,I'm being rude to him. I'm such an uneducated man.,"""I'm being rude to him."" and ""I'm such an uneducated man.""","The first part acknowledges a specific behavior ('being rude'), but the second part extends this single behavior into a broad negative label about the entire character of the person ('such an uneducated man'). This is an example of labeling, where an individual assigns a global negative trait to themselves based on a single event or behavior, rather than seeing it as an isolated action.",Labeling
3559,I'm sick. My life is over.,"""I'm sick."" and ""My life is over.""","The statement ""My life is over"" is an extreme conclusion drawn from the fact ""I'm sick.""

""I'm not listening to you at all.""","The phrase ""Today's just the beginning"" and ""She's gonna get a lot of wine from now on"" indicate a prediction about the future without sufficient evidence, assuming that the situation will continue or escalate indefinitely. This fits the definition of Fortune-telling, where one predicts negative outcomes without basis. ""I'm not listening to you at all"" suggests shutting down dialogue, likely influenced by the negative forecast but doesn't directly indicate distortion itself.

This reflects a belief about the intentions and thoughts of others without direct evidence, which aligns with the cognitive distortion of mind reading. The speaker is attributing hostile motives to others based on their own interpretation rather than objective facts.",Mind Reading

The use of the word 'perhaps' indicates anticipation of an adverse outcome leading to a precautionary action (taking sick leave and full check-up). This aligns with the cognitive distortion of Fortune-telling, where one predicts negative future events prematurely.",Fortune-telling
3563,I don't know what the disease is. I'm always holding my heart.,I don't know what the disease is. I'm always holding my heart.,"The speaker expresses uncertainty about the cause of their symptoms ('I don't know what the disease is') and claims a habitual physical response ('I'm always holding my heart'). The phrase 'always holding my heart' indicates a magnified sense of physical discomfort or worry, suggesting an exaggeration of the problem's severity. There is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, labeling, or definitive prediction of the future (fortune-telling). Instead, the focus is on the intensity and frequency of the symptom or worry, which aligns with 'Magnification' because the speaker is emphasizing the distressing nature of their condition beyond a neutral observation.",Magnification

This reflects mind reading, where one believes they know what someone else is thinking. The other parts of the statement express comparisons but do not necessarily involve other distortions like magnification or labeling. The key distortion lies in presuming the other person's attitude from their look.",Mind Reading
3565,I've got a cold. I'm really tired. I really want to get some rest.,I've got a cold. I'm really tired. I really want to get some rest.,"The statement describes the current physical state (cold and tired) and a desire (wanting rest). It does not involve exaggerated thinking (all-or-nothing, magnification), assumptions about others' thoughts (mind reading), predicting the future (fortune-telling), making absolute statements (should statements), negative labeling, or personalization. Instead, it presents a factual description and a natural response to feeling unwell without distorting reality. Therefore, there is no cognitive distortion in this statement.",No Distortion

Only I can believe it.,"""I can't believe anything in this world"", ""Only I can believe it""","The statement expresses a global doubt toward the entire world ('can't believe anything in this world'), implying an extreme, absolute perspective without exceptions. It also elevates the speaker's own belief as the sole valid one ('Only I can believe it'), suggesting a black-and-white view with no middle ground or flexibility. This rigid, absolute pattern of thinking aligns with All-or-Nothing Thinking, where situations are viewed in extremes rather than a continuum.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3567,Who cares about me when I'm alone? I'm destined to be loved forever.,"""Who cares about me when I'm alone?"" and ""I'm destined to be loved forever.""","The first phrase ""Who cares about me when I'm alone?"" implies a belief that no one cares about the speaker when they are alone, which generalizes the situation across all time and circumstances without specific evidence. This shows overgeneralization by making a broad conclusion based on a current or assumed event. The second phrase ""I'm destined to be loved forever"" predicts a definite future event without evidence, which aligns with fortune-telling. However, since the statement contains two parts that each reflect different distortions, the primary focus is on the first phrase that sets the negative cognitive bias. Given the instruction to choose one distortion, the dominant negative overgeneralization is the more fitting label compared to the positive future prediction (destined to be loved forever) which is unrealistic but not typically distressing.",Overgeneralization
3568,It's like I'm not feeling well all the time. I'm sure I was sick at the time.,"""I'm not feeling well all the time"", ""I'm sure I was sick at the time""","The speaker expresses a feeling of not feeling well consistently (all the time) and uses this internal feeling as evidence that they were indeed sick at that time.

The initial doubt is based on an internal emotional state rather than objective evidence, indicating reliance on feelings to judge reality.

This reflects a generalized conclusion based on limited evidence ('every time', 'once'). The phrase 'I can't change it' indicates a fixed, overbroad negative expectation. These elements point to overgeneralization, where a single event is viewed as an unending pattern.",Overgeneralization

This involves attributing external events or others' reactions directly to oneself, which indicates a personalization distortion. The statement also involves labeling themselves as 'mean', which is negative self-labeling, but the core distortion is the assumption that their presence is the cause of others' distress or illness (personalization).",Personalization

The speaker is drawing an absolute boundary based on a single action and generalizing the consequences in all-or-nothing terms.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3577,Feels like he's tired every day. Will I keep her from studying?,"""Feels like he's tired every day"", ""Will I keep her from studying?""","The statement ""Feels like he's tired every day"" represents an assumption about the person's emotional/physical state without direct evidence — potentially mind reading or emotional reasoning. The question ""Will I keep her from studying?"" predicts a negative future outcome without certainty. Since the person is assuming both feelings of another (he's tired) and predicting a future event (keeping her from studying) based on feelings or inference rather than facts, the dominant distortion here involves making predictions about the future without evidence, which matches 'Fortune-telling'.",Fortune-telling
3578,"The family seems to be very busy, and I should wait until they get a little free time to consult with them.","""I should wait until they get a little free time to consult with them.""","The key phrase indicates a personal rule or expectation about how things ought to be done ('I should wait'). This reflects an internal demand or obligation rather than an objective fact. 'Should statements' involve rigid rules or expectations about oneself or others, leading to feelings of pressure or frustration. The sentence does not involve jumping to conclusions about others' thoughts (Mind Reading), predicting the future (Fortune-telling), or other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking or personalization. Instead, it is centered on an internal 'should' that guides behavior.",Should statements
3579,"The epidemic will continue, and I should learn more about the variables of the future.","""The epidemic will continue"", ""I should learn more about the variables of the future""","The phrase ""The epidemic will continue"" reflects a prediction about the future, which aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Fortune-telling, where someone predicts the outcome of events negatively or prematurely without sufficient evidence. The second phrase ""I should learn more about the variables of the future"" involves a 'should' statement, which is another distortion where rigid rules or expectations are imposed on oneself or others. However, since only one distortion must be selected, and the key cognitive distortion in the statement revolves around predicting the continuation of the epidemic (a future event), Fortune-telling is the most relevant distortion here. The presence of a 'should' statement supports the learning attitude but does not in itself define the distortion as the predictive element is stronger.",Fortune-telling

The statement ""We can't get into conflict every day"" suggests a perceived rule or absolute standard about conflict frequency. Together, these imply seeing the situation in terms of extremes without middle ground. The plan to ""have some time to chat with her"" does not indicate distortion but a problem-solving approach. The dominant cognitive distortion here is viewing the situation as all or nothing, a characteristic of All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

There is an assumption about the group's closeness without direct evidence (""They seem to be very close""), but the statement does not indicate certainty about the group’s feelings or intentions toward the speaker. The speaker plans to take action to change the situation. There is no indication of predicting the future negatively without evidence (Fortune-telling), or making broad conclusions based on limited evidence (Overgeneralization). There also is no evident labeling, emotional reasoning, magnification, personalization, or should statements.

This aligns with 'Mind Reading' because the speaker assumes to know the intent and approach of others internally, rather than based on observable facts. There is no evidence of emotional reasoning, magnification, or all-or-nothing thinking. The statement also does not generalize or label, nor does it involve predictions about the future or should-statements.",Mind Reading

They are the ones who blame me and never understand me.","""they will surely curse me for not having any conscience"", ""They are the ones who blame me and never understand me.""","The speaker predicts a negative reaction from others ('they will surely curse me'), which involves assuming knowledge of others' thoughts and feelings without evidence. Additionally, the phrases imply the speaker believes others are blaming and misunderstanding them, which again reflects assumptions about others' internal states. These aspects align with the definition of Mind Reading, where one assumes they know what others think or feel without concrete evidence.",Mind Reading
3588,How can I reveal people's secrets so easily when I have experienced an extremely embarrassing and embarrassing situation?,"""How can I reveal people's secrets so easily"" and ""I have experienced an extremely embarrassing and embarrassing situation""","The statement links the speaker's perceived ability to reveal secrets with their experience of embarrassment. It implies an assumption about others' thoughts or feelings (that they are secretive or that the speaker can 'read' them easily) without concrete evidence. The question 'How can I reveal people's secrets so easily' suggests the speaker believes they have insight into others' private information, which aligns with assuming to know others' mental states without verification.",Mind Reading

This indicates personalization, where the individual assumes responsibility or causation for external events without objective evidence. It is not all-or-nothing thinking or labeling because the focus is on cause and blame rather than global identity or extremes. It isn't emotional reasoning since the conclusion isn't drawn from emotion but from an assumed cause-effect link. Mind reading, fortune telling, or magnification are not applicable as there is no speculation about others' thoughts or future events, nor exaggeration.

This reflects a forecasting about future or ongoing events based on current circumstances. However, it is stated as a certainty without explicit evidence, which is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling'—predicting negative outcomes in advance without verification. The statement does not show distorted emotional reasoning, labeling, or other distortions like all-or-nothing or personalization.",Fortune-telling
3593,"I'm not a good teacher, I teach students like that, and neither school nor parents will accept me.","""I'm not a good teacher"", ""I teach students like that"", ""neither school nor parents will accept me""","The statement shows a negative global judgment about oneself as a teacher (""I'm not a good teacher""), followed by a prediction that neither schools nor parents will accept the speaker. This involves making a broad, sweeping conclusion based on limited evidence and assuming continuous negative outcomes without considering exceptions. The phrase ""neither school nor parents will accept me"" reflects a future prediction without evidence, consistent with fortune-telling. The labeling distortion is close because of the self-judgment, but the key prominence of the predicted rejection by others makes Fortune-telling the better fit here.",Fortune-telling
3594,I'm sick and tired of thinking that they all have talent shows. I'd rather go back to my room and brush my phone.,"""I'm sick and tired of thinking that they all have talent shows.""","The phrase ""they all have talent shows"" generalizes a specific belief or feeling about 'they' as a whole group without evidence for every individual case.

Additionally, the claim that 'everything is usually left at the door' suggests a broad generalization about how such situations are handled. This type of thinking exemplifies 'Fortune-telling' because the speaker is predicting a negative scenario as a certainty before it occurs.",Fortune-telling
3597,Teacher must hate me now. I won't look good again.,"""Teacher must hate me now"", ""I won't look good again""","The phrase ""Teacher must hate me now"" involves assuming to know the teacher's thoughts or feelings without evidence, which matches 'Mind Reading'. The phrase ""I won't look good again"" predicts a negative future outcome, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling'. Since the instruction is to choose ONE distortion, the first phrase is more dominant as it reflects directly on others' thoughts. Therefore, the primary distortion is 'Mind Reading'.",Mind Reading

The feeling of ""endless pressure crushing me"" indicates emotional reasoning, interpreting emotional state as reality. However, the most significant distortion is in the statement ""only suicide can bring true happiness,"" which reflects all-or-nothing thinking by suggesting that only an extreme and absolute solution (suicide) can yield any happiness, discounting any middle ground or other possibilities.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This implies taking a single negative aspect or moment and extending it indefinitely into the future without considering potential changes. Such a pattern matches the cognitive distortion where one draws broad, generalized conclusions beyond the evidence given.",Overgeneralization
3600,I'll die on the street with rats and stray dogs.,"""I'll die on the street with rats and stray dogs.""","The statement predicts a very negative and specific future outcome without evidence, assuming the worst possible scenario will happen.

3601,Parents must think I'm lazy. Make excuses for not studying.,"""Parents must think I'm lazy""; ""Make excuses for not studying""","The phrase ""Parents must think I'm lazy"" reflects an assumption about what others are thinking without direct evidence, which fits the definition of mind reading. The second part, ""Make excuses for not studying,"" seems more like a personal justification rather than a cognitive distortion itself. Since the main distortion in the statement is the assumption about parents' thoughts, the distortion corresponds to mind reading.",Mind Reading
3602,I'm supposed to keep up with my roommate's hard work and learn with him.,"""I'm supposed to keep up with my roommate's hard work and learn with him.""","The phrase ""I'm supposed to"" indicates a rule or expectation the speaker believes they must follow. This reflects the cognitive distortion where individuals impose strict 'shoulds' or 'musts' on themselves or others, resulting in feelings of pressure or guilt. The statement highlights an internal demand rather than a balanced or flexible view, which aligns with the 'Should statements' distortion.",Should statements
3603,"Those people are cold-hearted, selfish and insensitive visitors. I won't believe them.","""Those people are cold-hearted, selfish and insensitive visitors. I won't believe them.""","The statement assigns a fixed, negative label to 'those people' by calling them 'cold-hearted, selfish and insensitive,' which is a direct example of labeling. It generalizes the entire group with negative traits instead of focusing on specific behaviors or instances. The phrase 'I won't believe them' supports this negative labeling by rejecting any potential positive interaction or explanation. This is not an example of all-or-nothing thinking since it doesn't show black-and-white extremes about actions or outcomes; it is not fortune-telling since no future outcome is predicted beyond disbelief; it is not emotional reasoning as it’s primarily about labeling others rather than basing a belief solely on feelings. Thus, the key distortion here is labeling.",Labeling

I won't eat anymore.""","The statement reflects a rigid mindset about eating bugs right now and postponing eating bread later, implying a strict division or absolute boundary in behavior. This indicates an 'all-or-nothing' approach, where the speaker is not allowing any flexibility—either they eat bugs or they wait for bread, with a declaration of no further eating beyond those choices. There is no evidence of assuming emotions as facts, predicting the future, labeling oneself, or other distortions from the list.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

This fits the pattern of Fortune-telling, where one predicts negative future outcomes without sufficient evidence. The second part, ""It's important to be happy now,"" appears to be a realistic or adaptive thought emphasizing present happiness, not a distortion. Therefore, the primary distortion lies in the pessimistic forecast about achieving Prince Charming, which is best categorized as Fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling

This exaggeration of the negative effect of coffee exemplifies magnification, as the event is blown out of proportion. The phrase ""ruins my day"" suggests the speaker is focusing on this single factor as the cause of an overall bad day, but it does not necessarily represent all-or-nothing thinking or other distortions that involve globalizing or labeling. The distorted thought illustrates an exaggerated negative evaluation of a situation, so magnification fits best.",Magnification

The phrase 'I keep putting things around' and 'I can't find them every time' supports this by providing evidence perceived as confirming this label. There is no indication of all-or-nothing thinking or fortune-telling. Emotional reasoning is not primarily evident, and there are no 'should' statements or magnification of negative events specifically. Overgeneralization might be considered, but the defining feature is labeling, as the individual defines themselves by a negative trait.",Labeling

3627,We don't even have a fair distribution of school exams.,We don't even have a fair distribution of school exams,"The statement asserts that the distribution of school exams is unfair. This implies a general judgment about the entire system of exam distribution. While the claim points to an unfairness, it does not provide evidence about every instance, yet it suggests a broad conclusion about the distribution as a whole. This generalization that the distribution is unfair overall reflects an overgeneralization cognitive distortion, where one negative aspect is extended to the entire context.",Overgeneralization

Additionally, the statement ""It's all because of the bad air I've brought"" shows personalization, as the speaker takes excessive responsibility for a negative outcome. However, since the task is to decide on one final distortion, the core distortion is labeling, as the self-judgment defines the speaker's entire self-concept rather than merely attributing cause-effect (personalization).",Labeling

The phrase ""if only I had been aware"" suggests a conditional 'should have' mindset. However, there is no absolute or extreme belief (which would indicate All-or-Nothing thinking), nor is there prediction about the future (Fortune-telling), or assuming others' thoughts (Mind Reading).

This involves assigning a global negative label to the police as a group rather than focusing on specific behaviors. Additionally, the speaker concludes they cannot rely on the police anymore, reflecting a negative generalization.

The individual is attaching a negative label to themselves as 'naive'. The latter part, ""I can't help but see reality now,"" suggests a perceived sudden clarity or enlightenment but does not imply cognitive distortion. The key distortion is in the labeling of oneself as naive, which is a global, negative self-judgment rather than a balanced assessment. This fits best with the 'Labeling' cognitive distortion where one assigns a fixed negative trait to oneself.",Labeling

They also assume others' feelings (the shame of the whole family) and their own future inability to face their parents, which seems to stem from an emotionally charged conclusion rather than objective evidence.

The speaker assumes that others' effort is specifically directed at outdoing them, which indicates making assumptions about others' motives without concrete evidence. This relates closely to 'Mind Reading,' where one believes they know what others are thinking or planning. The latter parts express personal boundaries but don't indicate a distortion themselves. There is no evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, or other listed distortions.

This is a clear example of making a negative prediction about future events, which fits the definition of 'Fortune-telling.' It is not all-or-nothing because the statement doesn't express an absolute good/bad boundary but predicts the future poorly. It is not labeling or personalization, nor emotional reasoning since the statement asserts a future fact rather than relying solely on feelings.

The phrase 'hard for people to see' suggests an assumption about others' inability to recognize or be aware of certain information, which aligns with the definition of Mind Reading—believing you know what others think or perceive without concrete evidence. There is no prediction about future events (Fortune-telling), no extreme either/or thinking, no labeling of self or others, no magnification or filtering of certain aspects, no emotional reasoning, personalization, or should statements involved.",Mind Reading
3679,"A serious effort to practice, bearing in mind each and every focus, to try again will go smoothly.","A serious effort to practice, bearing in mind each and every focus, to try again will go smoothly.","The statement expresses a positive expectation that trying again with serious effort and full focus will lead to a smooth outcome. This reflects predicting a future event with certainty based on current effort, which aligns with 'Fortune-telling' distortion, where the person assumes they know the definite outcome even though it is uncertain.",Fortune-telling
3680,Why does he say I'm not important? I'm a weak person.,Why does he say I'm not important? I'm a weak person.,"The first part 'Why does he say I'm not important?' suggests an assumption about the other person's thoughts or intentions without concrete evidence, indicating mind reading. The second part 'I'm a weak person' is a negative global label applied to oneself based on this assumption. The statement moves from assuming someone else's thoughts to labeling oneself negatively. Considering the key cognitive distortion types, the phrase 'I'm a weak person' fits best with Labeling, which involves assigning a negative global trait to oneself.",Labeling
3681,The passers-by would laugh at me with a cold ass on my face when he saw it.,The passers-by would laugh at me with a cold ass on my face when he saw it.,"The statement assumes that the passers-by will laugh at the speaker without any concrete evidence; it predicts a negative outcome based on limited or no actual information. This anticipates future events negatively, which fits the pattern of making assumptions about what others are thinking or what will happen. Therefore, this is an example of 'Fortune-telling.'",Fortune-telling
3682,"Why should I be a girl? If I were a boy, there wouldn't be so much shit.","Why should I be a girl? If I were a boy, there wouldn't be so much shit.","The statement uses 'should' to question the speaker's gender identity in a way that implies an expectation or rule about how things ought to be. The phrase 'If I were a boy, there wouldn't be so much shit' reflects a belief that being a girl inherently causes problems, which ties into an unrealistic or rigid expectation about gender experiences. This aligns with the cognitive distortion called 'Should statements,' where the person imposes stringent rules or expectations that lead to distress.",Should statements
3683,What kind of world is this?,"""What kind of world is this?""","The statement expresses a sense of confusion or dismay about the state of the world, implying a negative judgment or disbelief. It reflects a sweeping generalization about the world as a whole rather than focusing on a specific event or circumstance. This is indicative of overgeneralization, where a person draws a broad conclusion about a large aspect (the world) based on limited or specific experiences or feelings, often leading to a distorted perception.",Overgeneralization
3684,It happened because I didn't give any help to those who needed it. It was God's punishment.,"""It happened because I didn't give any help to those who needed it."" ""It was God's punishment.""","The first phrase attributes the cause of an event directly to the speaker's lack of help, which is a form of Personalization, where one assumes excessive responsibility for external outcomes. The second phrase interprets the event as a form of divine punishment, linking an outcome to a specific moral cause without direct evidence, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning where feelings or beliefs dictate the perceived reality. However, since the main cognitive distortion is the assumption of personal responsibility for the event's cause, Personalization is the most fitting label here.",Personalization
3685,I gave them a bad first impression that they wouldn't talk to me.,"""I gave them a bad first impression"" and ""they wouldn't talk to me""","The statement assumes the thoughts and reactions of others without evidence, specifically presuming that others won't talk to the speaker due to a perceived bad first impression. This reflects an assumption about another person's internal state or intentions. Among the listed distortions, 'Mind Reading' involves believing you know what others are thinking without concrete proof. The statement does not fit perfectly with other distortions such as Fortune-telling (predicting the future more broadly), Labeling (assigning negative labels), or Emotional Reasoning (inferring truth based on feelings). Therefore, the best fit is 'Mind Reading'.",Mind Reading
3686,"The epidemic has become normal, and it is bound to become frequent and may have serious after-effects.","The epidemic has become normal, it is bound to become frequent, may have serious after-effects","The statement predicts that the epidemic will definitely become more frequent and will have serious consequences. These are future predictions presented with certainty without evidence, reflecting an assumption about future events that may or may not happen. This aligns with the cognitive distortion commonly known as Fortune-telling, where one assumes negative outcomes will definitely occur.",Fortune-telling
3687,I don't deserve my wife. I don't deserve to be her husband.,"""I don't deserve my wife""; ""I don't deserve to be her husband""","The statement reflects a negative, fixed judgment about oneself without presenting evidence or context, implying a global negative self-assessment. The speaker concludes they do not 'deserve' their wife or the role of husband, which is a harsh, all-encompassing negative evaluation of themselves. This fits the definition of labeling, where an individual assigns themselves a negative label based on one or a few characteristics or feelings. It is not all-or-nothing thinking because the focus is the negative label rather than polarizing outcomes. It is not personalization, fortune-telling, or mind reading because it is a self-judgment rather than interpreting others’ thoughts or predicting the future.",Labeling
3688,"My wife would have hated me for having an affair with my children, and I didn't think I could do it.","""My wife would have hated me for having an affair with my children"", ""I didn't think I could do it""","The statement reflects an assumption about what the wife’s feelings would be (that she would hate the speaker) without explicit evidence, which is a form of mind reading. The speaker assumes knowledge of the wife's reaction and emotions. There is no mention of certainty about the future (fortune-telling), nor is there a global negative self-assessment or labeling. The statement is not about categorically good or bad outcomes, nor does it involve exaggerated consequences, filtering, or should statements. Hence, the main distortion is attributing thoughts/feelings to another person without direct evidence.",Mind Reading

This suggests a black-and-white view where either one succeeds completely or fails altogether, with no middle ground or alternative possibilities considered. This reflects All-or-Nothing Thinking where outcomes are perceived in extremes without recognizing nuances.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

The use of 'can't' and the repetition of 'can't keep him company' suggest a rigid, black-and-white thinking pattern without acknowledging any possible middle ground or nuance. This reflects a cognitive distortion where the individual sees the situation in extremes rather than a spectrum of possibilities.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

3692,"Although parents do not earn much, they give me the greatest care and attention within their abilities.","parents do not earn much, they give me the greatest care and attention within their abilities","The statement acknowledges a limitation (parents do not earn much) but emphasizes a positive aspect (greatest care and attention within their abilities). There is no evidence of distorted thinking patterns such as extreme thinking, negative labeling, or assuming negative future outcomes. The statement presents a balanced and realistic view without exaggeration or negative bias.",No Distortion
3693,I'm so kind to you that he's even more angry.,"""I'm so kind to you"" and ""he's even more angry""","The statement assumes that the speaker's kindness should reduce anger, and since the anger has increased, it implies a cause-effect relationship without evidence. The speaker is interpreting another person's emotional state (anger) based on their own actions and feelings, which fits the pattern of 'Mind Reading' — assuming to know what others think or feel without concrete proof.",Mind Reading
3694,"The doctor said I needed to go to the main hospital for a further medical examination, but although it was not detected for the time being, I believe it could be cured.","The doctor said I needed to go to the main hospital for a further medical examination, but although it was not detected for the time being, I believe it could be cured.","The statement reflects the individual's belief that despite the current lack of detection, there is an assumption that the condition could be cured. There is no evidence in the statement that the person is assuming a negative or catastrophic outcome (which would indicate fortune-telling), nor is the person making an absolute either/or judgment (all-or-nothing). The person is not interpreting others' thoughts (mind reading) nor blaming themselves (personalization). There are no 'should' statements or labels applied. There is a consideration of future positive outcome (cure), which suggests hope rather than distortion. Therefore, the statement does not clearly demonstrate any cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
3695,It doesn't matter if we're not here today. We'll eat together next time.,"""It doesn't matter if we're not here today."" ""We'll eat together next time.""","The speaker minimizes the significance of not being present today by reassuring that there will be another opportunity later. This reflects a way of diminishing the present negative situation by focusing on a future event, which does not align with cognitive distortions but rather indicates a rational and positive outlook. There is no evidence of exaggeration, negative labeling, fortune-telling, or emotional reasoning in the statement.",No Distortion
3696,He wouldn't answer his phone if he rang. He'd respect me so we wouldn't be interrupted.,"""He wouldn't answer his phone if he rang"", ""He'd respect me so we wouldn't be interrupted.""","The statement assumes the person's internal thoughts and intentions without direct evidence, specifically that 'he wouldn't answer his phone' and that 'he'd respect me,' implying a certainty about what he thinks and will do. This fits the pattern of mind reading, where someone infers another person's thoughts or intentions without explicit communication.",Mind Reading
3697,"I feel like my future is like this, and I'm never better than that kid.","""my future is like this"", ""I'm never better than that kid""","The statement ""my future is like this"" indicates a prediction about the future, assuming it will not improve or change. This aligns with the distortion of Fortune-telling, where one makes negative assumptions about future events without evidence. Additionally, ""I'm never better than that kid"" suggests a fixed, global negative outlook based on comparison, reinforcing the belief in a negative, unchangeable future condition. The primary distortion is Fortune-telling as the statement focuses on predicting a negative outcome about the future.",Fortune-telling
3698,I couldn't bear to eat so much. My diet plan is going to be ruined forever. I can't stand it.,My diet plan is going to be ruined forever.,"The phrase 'My diet plan is going to be ruined forever' shows a belief that one action (eating too much) will have an irreversible and total negative effect on the entire diet plan without considering any possibility for recovery or adjustment. This indicates a black-and-white, absolute way of thinking typical of 'All-or-Nothing Thinking'. The statement is not about feeling bad because of emotions alone (which would be Emotional Reasoning), nor is it predicting a future outcome with certainty independent of evidence (Fortune-telling). It also does not involve labeling, magnification, or others on the list as centrally as it does All-or-Nothing Thinking.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3699,"I can't accept the dirty side of my dream job, and I'm angry that the business I loved was completely ruined.","I can't accept the dirty side of my dream job, I'm angry that the business I loved was completely ruined.","The statement reflects a rigid perception that the dream job should be free of negative aspects ('dirty side'), which is unrealistic. The use of 'completely ruined' indicates a belief that the entire business is destroyed with no positive parts remaining. This reflects black-and-white thinking with no middle ground, aligning with All-or-Nothing Thinking. Although there is anger and a negative emotional response, the core distortion is not based on feeling (emotional reasoning) but on the dichotomous evaluation.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3700,"I'm going to turn stress into power, and I'm going to learn like my roommate.","""I'm going to turn stress into power"", ""I'm going to learn like my roommate""","The statement expresses a positive outlook and personal commitment to transform stress into a beneficial force and to emulate the learning style of the roommate. It does not involve negative or erroneous thinking patterns such as extreme absolutes (All-or-Nothing), assuming feelings as facts (Emotional Reasoning), predicting a negative future (Fortune-telling), or any other listed cognitive distortions. Instead, it reflects a realistic, goal-oriented mindset without cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
3701,"Leadership is a maniac old woman, talking to her is a waste of time!","""Leadership is a maniac old woman"", ""talking to her is a waste of time!""","The statement uses a harsh label ""maniac old woman"" to describe the leader, reducing the person to a negative and demeaning stereotype. This is an example of labeling, which involves assigning a fixed, unfavorable trait to someone rather than viewing them in a more balanced or nuanced way. Additionally, the claim that talking to her is a waste of time further supports the negative labeling and dismissal based on the label. There is no clear evidence of other distortions like all-or-nothing thinking (which involves absolute terms like 'always' or 'never'), fortune-telling (predicting future outcomes without evidence), or mind reading (assuming knowledge of another's thoughts). Therefore, labeling is the most fitting distortion.",Labeling
3702,He doesn't love me anymore. I'm sure I won't be liked.,"""He doesn't love me anymore"", ""I'm sure I won't be liked""","The first phrase ""He doesn't love me anymore"" is a specific belief about one person's feelings, which could be true or false. The second phrase ""I'm sure I won't be liked"" is a prediction about future social acceptance without evidence, reflecting certainty about an uncertain outcome. This is characteristic of 'Fortune-telling,' where the person assumes they know what will happen in the future with no basis.",Fortune-telling

This reflects anticipating future events or situations negatively without proof. This aligns with the cognitive distortion known as Fortune-telling, where one assumes the worst will inevitably happen.",Fortune-telling
3704,It's embarrassing. I'm disgraced. I can't live anymore.,"""It's embarrassing."" ""I'm disgraced."" ""I can't live anymore.""","The statement includes feelings of intense shame and hopelessness. The phrase ""I'm disgraced"" assigns a global negative label to the self, implying a fixed, overwhelmingly negative identity. ""It's embarrassing"" reflects emotional reasoning, but the key phrase ""I'm disgraced"" is a clear example of labeling where the person defines themselves with a negative and damaging label. The final phrase ""I can't live anymore"" shows exaggeration, but overall, the core cognitive distortion is labeling.",Labeling
3705,"I'm sure I'll keep my head empty, and I'm not going to make any progress.","""I'm sure I'll keep my head empty""; ""I'm not going to make any progress""","The statement involves a certain prediction about the future (not making progress) stated with certainty ('I'm sure'). This reflects forecasting a negative outcome without evidence. The speaker assumes a negative future event will happen for certain. This aligns closely with 'Fortune-telling', where one predicts future events negatively without supporting facts.",Fortune-telling

My life's a failure.,"""Even dogs can bully me these days."", ""I don't live as well as a dog."", ""My life's a failure.""","The speaker is making a broad, negative conclusion about their entire life based on specific experiences where they feel bullied and unsuccessful. Saying ""My life's a failure"" after feeling bullied and comparing themselves unfavorably to dogs indicates a global, sweeping negative judgment. This is characteristic of overgeneralization, where a single or few events lead to a broad negative view about oneself or one's life.",Overgeneralization

The speaker is also assuming how others feel about them (""the rest of the company doesn't want me""), which aligns with Mind Reading but is intertwined with the prediction about future events occurring due to company cutbacks (being thrown out). The primary distortion here is the assumption about future negative events and judgments that are not based on facts but on the speaker's predictions. Therefore, Fortune-telling is the best fit.",Fortune-telling

It expresses a pragmatic and hopeful mindset, suggesting persistence will eventually yield results ('one day has to pay off if it is done'). There is no evidence of extreme dichotomous thinking, nor predictions about the future that are negative or certain. No emotional reasoning or magnification of negativity is present. Instead, the speaker uses a realistic and balanced approach to acknowledge difficulties while emphasizing perseverance. Thus, the statement does not exhibit any cognitive distortion.",No Distortion

However, it quickly moves into interpreting others' perceptions definitively—claiming that others see the speaker as unimportant and someone who can be disregarded. This assumes knowledge of others' thoughts without evidence, which is a hallmark of mind reading. The speaker infers how others view them based solely on the action of being stood up, which is speculative rather than certain.",Mind Reading

I'm a piece of shit and I don't deserve it.,"""It's my own fault I didn't do it."", ""I can't do anything."", ""I'm a piece of shit and I don't deserve it.""","The statement includes blaming oneself entirely for the failure (personal fault), expressing an inability to do anything (global negative self-assessment), and using a harsh negative label on the self ('piece of shit'). The key phrase 'I'm a piece of shit' exemplifies labeling, which is the distortion of attaching a negative and extreme label to oneself rather than focusing on behavior or specific incidents.",Labeling
3712,People like me don't want to be friends with me.,"""People like me don't want to be friends with me.""","The statement assumes that others have a negative intention or feeling towards the speaker without concrete evidence. This involves making assumptions about what others are thinking or feeling, which corresponds to the definition of Mind Reading. The speaker is presuming to know others' thoughts ('People like me don't want to be friends') without verifying it. It is not all-or-nothing thinking because this is not a binary categorization, nor is it emotional reasoning because it does not infer reality based on feelings. It is also not fortune-telling since no future event is predicted explicitly. Labeling, magnification, mental filter, personalization, and should statements do not match as the distortion is about assuming others' thoughts. Overgeneralization might be considered, but the focus here is on assumed others' thoughts rather than broad conclusions. Therefore, Mind Reading is the best fit.",Mind Reading
3713,I'm so stressed out that I'm completely numb. I don't feel anything.,I'm so stressed out that I'm completely numb. I don't feel anything.,"The speaker attributes their numbness directly to feeling stressed, interpreting their emotional state as evidence of a specific fact ('I'm so stressed out that I'm completely numb'). This reflects emotional reasoning, where the individual assumes that because they feel a certain way (numb), it must be true that the stress is causing this numbness. There is no indication of exaggeration, absolute thinking, or assumptions about the future or others' thoughts. The focus is on the internal emotional state validating reality.",Emotional Reasoning

She makes me feel like everything's my fault.,My friends think I'm not even a person. I always push everybody away. My mom doesn't understand me. She makes me feel like everything's my fault.,"The statement ""My friends think I'm not even a person"" indicates an assumption about others' thoughts without evidence, which aligns with mind reading. ""I always push everybody away"" is a generalization about behavior across all instances. ""My mom doesn't understand me"" is a perception of another person's feelings or intentions. ""She makes me feel like everything's my fault"" involves taking responsibility for others' feelings or actions, reflecting personalization. Among these, the strongest and most pervasive distortion here is 'Mind Reading' because the speaker assumes knowledge of what friends think without factual basis. Personalization is present but is secondary to the assumed knowledge of others' thoughts.",Mind Reading

The second part, 'there is nothing I can do to make up for it,' suggests a sense of helplessness but does not predict the future or assign blame. The statement does not indicate all-or-nothing thinking by presenting an extreme black-and-white scenario; rather, it focuses on feelings dictating reality. This aligns closely with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are taken as evidence of fact.",Emotional Reasoning

With you around me, I will never be truly free.","""Your concern and love are truly superfluous for me,"" ""they only make me feel heavy and painful,"" ""I want to be free,"" ""With you around me, I will never be truly free.""","The speaker interprets the presence and concern of another person as inherently negative and limiting their freedom. They are concluding that the other person's love and concern necessarily cause them pain and prevent their freedom. This is a form of thinking where the emotions experienced (feeling heavy and painful) are used as objective evidence that the concern is unwanted and restrictive. The speaker is reasoning based on their feelings rather than facts (emotional reasoning). Moreover, the statement 'With you around me, I will never be truly free' is a prediction about the future that does not consider possible changes or other perspectives, but this prediction is closely tied to the feelings rather than a clear-cut fortune-telling distortion. The dominant distortion is Emotional Reasoning as the individual assumes their feelings about the other person’s concern reflect the actual nature and impact of that concern.",Emotional Reasoning

They assume what the other person thinks and feels, specifically stating he doesn't like or care about them, and only cares about drugs and money. This indicates that the speaker is attributing thoughts and motives to someone else without verifying, which aligns with 'Mind Reading'. There is no indication that these are extreme all-or-nothing judgments, predictions about the future, or emotional reasoning based only on feelings. The primary cognitive distortion is making assumptions about the other’s inner thoughts and feelings without evidence.",Mind Reading

The rest of us just treat me like shit.,"'I'm such a piece of shit', 'My parents don't want to see me', 'The rest of us just treat me like shit.'","The speaker labels themselves negatively with an extreme phrase ('piece of shit'), which is a direct application of a negative label to oneself. The other statements reinforce this negative self-label by suggesting rejection from parents and others. The key element here is the self-labeling with a derogatory term rather than just describing specific behaviors or events, which aligns with the cognitive distortion called Labeling.",Labeling

""The world belongs to young people."" ""What does it have to do with old people like me?""","The statement generalizes the notion that all old people are not productive or valuable, implying a universal truth about aging. It extends this assumption to the speaker's personal identity ('old people like me'), suggesting a negative view of oneself based on age.

3721,"I didn't do well to make him think I wasn't worthy of respect, and I had to improve myself.","I didn't do well to make him think I wasn't worthy of respect, and I had to improve myself.","The statement implies that the speaker believes their actions caused another person to think they were unworthy of respect, which is taking personal responsibility for someone else's thoughts or feelings. This is a classic example of Personalization, where one assumes undue responsibility for external events or others' reactions. The presence of 'I had to improve myself' suggests self-blame. There is no evidence of predicting the future (Fortune-telling), all-or-nothing extremes, or other distortions listed.",Personalization
3722,Kids are disgusting. They don't listen. They just cheat.,"""Kids are disgusting"", ""They don't listen"", ""They just cheat""","The statement uses a sweeping negative evaluation of 'Kids' as a group by calling them 'disgusting' and attributing negative behaviors such as not listening and cheating to all of them. This suggests a global judgment from limited examples, which is characteristic of overgeneralization. The phrase 'Kids are disgusting' is a negative label that summarizes the entire group without nuance, fitting into labeling. However, the key focus is the broad negative stereotype applied to all kids based on perceived behaviors, which aligns most closely with overgeneralization rather than a single-instance label or an all-or-nothing perspective.",Overgeneralization
3723,My only hope is gone. What do you mean I'm still alive?,"""My only hope is gone""; ""What do you mean I'm still alive?""","The phrase ""My only hope is gone"" reflects a belief that there is absolutely no hope left, indicating an 'all-or-nothing' perspective where the situation is seen in black-and-white terms—either complete hope or none at all. The follow-up ""What do you mean I'm still alive?"" expresses disbelief and emotional turmoil about one's survival, suggesting that the person equates being alive with having hope, and since they feel hopeless, they deny the fact of their survival. This denotes emotional reasoning, where feelings are taken as evidence of reality. However, the dominant distortion is the initial absolutist view of hope, which is a classic example of All-or-Nothing Thinking, as the person sees hope in absolute terms rather than along a continuum.",All-or-Nothing Thinking

""I can never satisfy him"" generalizes inability to satisfy the person at all times, suggesting Overgeneralization. ""I blame him"" suggests shifting responsibility rather than cognitive distortion. Among these, the primary distortion is ""Mind Reading"" because the statement assumes knowledge of another person's thoughts and feelings without verification.",Mind Reading

This shows taking excessive personal responsibility for external events, indicating personalization. The speaker labels themselves as 'useless,' which may suggest labeling, but the core distortion is the assumption that their shortcomings caused their mother's breakdown, consistent with personalization.",Personalization
3726,"No money to marry, no money to have children. It's nice to be alone. There's no stress.","""No money to marry, no money to have children. It's nice to be alone.

This creates a dichotomy where either one has money and participates in family life or remains alone without stress. The reasoning simplifies the situation into two opposite categories without any middle ground, reflecting an 'all-or-nothing' perspective. There is no evidence of making assumptions about future events (fortune-telling), attributing emotions as reality (emotional reasoning), or other cognitive distortions listed.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3727,"But my parents think I'm getting better, so now I have to keep them thinking that, because I don't want to put pressure on them anymore.",my parents think I'm getting better; I have to keep them thinking that; I don't want to put pressure on them anymore,"The statement involves assuming what the parents think ('my parents think I'm getting better') and acting based on that assumption (keeping them thinking that). The speaker is reading the parents' thoughts without direct evidence. This aligns with 'Mind Reading,' where one believes they know what others are thinking and bases behavior on that belief.",Mind Reading
3728,It's my fault if he doesn't want to play with me. I play too well. Nobody else wants to play with me.,"""It's my fault if he doesn't want to play with me"", ""I play too well"", ""Nobody else wants to play with me""","The statement blames oneself for another person's behavior, suggesting personal responsibility for their decision not to play. This aligns with Personalization, where one assumes excessive responsibility for external events. Additionally, the phrase ""Nobody else wants to play with me"" generalizes the situation from one experience to all others, indicating Overgeneralization. However, the most prominent distortion is assigning personal blame for someone else's choice, which is characteristic of Personalization.",Personalization
3729,I guess the change teacher scores by relationship. I don't think my curls are more than that. He doesn't like me.,"""I guess the change teacher scores by relationship."" ""He doesn't like me.""","The statement ""He doesn't like me"" reveals an assumption about another person's feelings or thoughts without direct evidence. This reflects the person thinking they know what the teacher feels or thinks about them, which fits the definition of 'Mind Reading.' The phrase about scores possibly being influenced by relationships shows suspicion but is less central than the direct assertion of the teacher's dislike. Therefore, the main cognitive distortion here is assuming one knows another person's mind without concrete proof.",Mind Reading
3730,I hope my fractures heal quickly so that I can avoid constant disturbance and I can feel no more embarrassment.,"I hope my fractures heal quickly, avoid constant disturbance, feel no more embarrassment","The speaker expresses a desire that healing will lead to the complete absence of disturbance and embarrassment. This implies a belief that if fractures do not heal quickly, they will continue to face constant disturbance and embarrassment. This suggests an all-or-nothing perspective—either full relief or ongoing negative experience—without acknowledging any middle ground or gradual improvement.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3731,I can't even comfort my friends. It's hard for me to make real friends for the rest of my life.,"""I can't even comfort my friends"" and ""It's hard for me to make real friends for the rest of my life.""","The first phrase expresses a current perceived inability to comfort friends, while the second phrase extends this perceived difficulty into a permanent, lifelong prediction. This is an example of drawing a broad, negative conclusion about the future based on a current situation, which aligns closely with the cognitive distortion known as Fortune-telling. The statement is not just about present difficulty but assumes an inevitable negative outcome in the future without evidence.",Fortune-telling
3732,They're in a better relationship than me. Let's go out together.,"""They're in a better relationship than me.""","The statement compares the speaker's relationship with another's in a way that implies a broad negative judgment about their own relationship. This is an example of seeing things in a comparative, negative light without concrete evidence, leading to a judgment that the other relationship is 'better.' However, it does not imply an absolute good or bad, nor is it predicting the future or assuming someone's thoughts. The phrase 'They're in a better relationship than me' expresses a comparative judgment, which points toward overgeneralizing the situation without nuance.",Overgeneralization
3733,They don't want to contact me because I'm not good enough because I'm not good enough.,They don't want to contact me because I'm not good enough,"The statement assumes the intentions and thoughts of others ('They don't want to contact me') without having direct evidence, which aligns with assuming what others are thinking. Additionally, it attributes the reason for their behavior to a negative self-assessment ('because I'm not good enough'), which supports the idea of interpreting others' motives based on one's feelings or beliefs rather than facts. This fits best with 'Mind Reading,' where a person believes they know what others think or feel without proof.",Mind Reading
3734,"I must have disturbed him. If it wasn't for me, he could have picked up the phone.","""I must have disturbed him.""; ""If it wasn't for me, he could have picked up the phone.""","The speaker assumes responsibility for someone's behavior or action without clear evidence, believing that their presence or action caused the other person not to answer the phone. This reflects taking blame personally, attributing an external event (the phone not being picked up) to oneself without sufficient proof.",Personalization
3735,"You're younger than I am, and you can't help it.","You're younger than I am, and you can't help it.","The statement identifies a fact about age difference ('You're younger than I am') and then implies a lack of control over it ('you can't help it'). The phrase 'you can't help it' suggests acceptance of an unchangeable trait, but it does not imply a judgment, exaggeration, or negative evaluation. It also does not involve predicting the future, attributing personal blame, or making absolute statements. There is no evidence of distorting generalizations, labeling, or emotional conclusion based on feelings. Therefore, the statement is a factual observation without cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
3736,Conflicts and frictions in life are only a human challenge that every independent individual has to face.,Conflicts and frictions in life are only a human challenge that every independent individual has to face.,"The statement generalizes the experience of conflicts and frictions as a universal challenge faced by every independent individual. This implies that because some people experience conflicts and frictions, it must be true for all independent individuals without exception. This broad application of a specific experience to all members of a group fits the pattern of overgeneralization, where a single event or limited evidence is extended to a wide and often unwarranted conclusion.",Overgeneralization
3737,I'm not as hard as my roommate is. I'm sure I'm gonna have to drop out at the end of the week.,"""I'm not as hard as my roommate is"", ""I'm sure I'm gonna have to drop out at the end of the week.""","The speaker compares themselves unfavorably to their roommate, implying they are less tough or capable. From this negative self-assessment, the speaker predicts with certainty that they will drop out soon. This prediction is made without actual evidence and assumes a negative outcome will definitely happen. This aligns with 'Fortune-telling,' where a person predicts a negative future event as inevitable.",Fortune-telling
3738,I have begun to see the negative impact of everything and see no improvement in my own future.,"see the negative impact of everything, see no improvement in my own future","The statement focuses solely on the negative aspects ('negative impact of everything'), which indicates filtering out any positive factors. Additionally, the prediction that there will be 'no improvement' suggests a belief that the future is certain to be negative. However, the main emphasis is on perceiving only the negative while disregarding any positive, which aligns with filtering (mental filter). Although there is an element of fortune-telling in predicting no improvement, the phrase 'negative impact of everything' highlights a selective attention to negative details more strongly.",Mental filter
3739,"And I have turned my backs on myself, so I bear the consequences of this day, and it is my duty to live and die.",I have turned my backs on myself; I bear the consequences of this day; it is my duty to live and die.,"The statement reflects a sense of personal responsibility and self-blame ('turned my backs on myself'), indicating the individual attributes negative outcomes entirely to their own actions. It also includes a strong moral imperative ('it is my duty to live and die'), suggestive of rigid expectations rather than a balanced view. The phrase 'turned my backs on myself' implies the person is internalizing fault for all negative consequences without considering external factors, consistent with personalization, where one blames oneself for events outside complete personal control.",Personalization
3740,It's a traffic jam. It's sick. It's boring.,"""It's a traffic jam. It's sick. It's boring.""","The speaker describes the traffic jam using strongly negative terms ('sick' and 'boring') without considering any neutral or positive aspects. They are making a judgment based on their emotional response to the situation rather than objective evidence. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are used as proof of an objective reality.",Emotional Reasoning
3741,"In the future, there will be less communication in private, except where there is a need for a hand-over at work.","In the future, there will be less communication in private, except where there is a need for a hand-over at work.","The statement makes a prediction about future communication, asserting that it will decrease in private contexts with a specific exception. This involves predicting a negative outcome without evidence, which aligns with the distortion of fortune-telling. It is not an all-or-nothing statement because it allows for a specific exception. It is not based on emotion, labeling, or mind reading. Therefore, the statement fits best with fortune-telling.",Fortune-telling
3742,"No problem, although it takes some time and effort, I am confident that I can lose those weights.","No problem, although it takes some time and effort, I am confident that I can lose those weights.","The statement reflects a positive and realistic mindset. The speaker acknowledges that losing weight requires time and effort, which is a pragmatic understanding of the process. They express confidence in their ability to achieve the goal, which indicates self-assurance rather than any distorted thinking. There is no evidence of negative or irrational thinking such as all-or-nothing, emotional reasoning, or fortune-telling. The tone is neither exaggerated nor unrealistic, so the statement contains no cognitive distortion.",No Distortion
3743,It's like it's gone. It's gone. It's like it's got its own leg.,"""It's like it's gone. It's gone. It's like it's got its own leg.""","The speaker is emphasizing the permanence and uncontrollability of a situation by repeatedly stating ""It's gone,"" reinforcing an extreme, absolute sense of loss. The phrase ""it's got its own leg"" suggests the situation is acting independently or uncontrollably, which implies a catastrophic perspective that overemphasizes the severity or impact beyond realistic appraisal. This reflects a cognitive distortion that exaggerates the significance of an event or condition.",Magnification
3744,I don't usually like making friends. It's better if nobody tells me to go out. I prefer to be alone.,"""I don't usually like making friends."" ""It's better if nobody tells me to go out."" ""I prefer to be alone.""","The statement generalizes a personal preference or feeling about social interaction into a broader conclusion about making friends and going out. The phrase ""I don't usually like making friends"" suggests a broad, default stance toward social interactions. This is indicative of taking one instance or feeling and extending it to cover most or all instances, which fits with overgeneralization. It is not all-or-nothing thinking because there isn't a strict dichotomy presented; rather it is presenting a consistent trend or pattern. There is no evidence of emotional reasoning, fortune-telling, labeling, magnification, mental filter, mind reading, personalization, or should statements.",Overgeneralization
3745,Every day they're talking to me. It's so hard for me to communicate with my family.,"""Every day they're talking to me"" and ""It's so hard for me to communicate with my family.""","The phrase ""Every day they're talking to me"" suggests a generalization about the family interaction frequency. The statement ""It's so hard for me to communicate with my family"" expresses a difficulty that seems to apply broadly, but the speaker does not specify particular instances, implying a general negative experience. The key here is the use of ""Every day"" which implies an assumption that this is a constant experience, pointing to an overgeneralized perception of the situation.",Overgeneralization
3746,"This is the evil consequence of my indigence and my health, and this is what we deserve.","evil consequence of my indigence and my health, and this is what we deserve","The statement attributes a negative outcome directly to the speaker's own shortcomings ('indigence and my health') and concludes that the negative outcome is deserved. This shows the speaker blaming themselves for the situation, implying a sense of responsibility for events that might not be entirely under their control. This is characteristic of Personalization, where one takes responsibility for negative events unnecessarily.",Personalization
3747,He thinks I'm being rude. He must be starting to hate me.,"""He thinks I'm being rude."" and ""He must be starting to hate me.""","The statement assumes knowledge of another person's thoughts and feelings without concrete evidence. The speaker is claiming to know what the other person thinks ('He thinks I'm being rude') and is also predicting an emotional reaction from this person ('He must be starting to hate me'). This aligns with the definition of 'Mind Reading,' where one presumes to know what others are thinking or feeling. It is not 'Fortune-telling' because the focus is on interpreting current thoughts and feelings rather than predicting future events beyond this emotional assumption.",Mind Reading
3748,I've sacrificed so much time for the community to be president. That's good. Nothing.,I've sacrificed so much time for the community to be president. That's good. Nothing.,"The speaker emphasizes the extensive effort (sacrificed so much time) put into a goal (being president), acknowledging it as 'good,' but then dismisses the outcome as 'Nothing.' This reflects a tendency to see the outcome in absolute negative terms despite positive aspects, indicating black-and-white or absolutist thinking. The phrase 'That's good. Nothing.' suggests an evaluation that either it is completely good or completely worthless, with no middle ground. This fits the profile of All-or-Nothing Thinking, where the situation is seen in extremes rather than a balanced perspective.",All-or-Nothing Thinking
3749,"I may need to make progress in some places, which is really my problem, and I need to redouble my efforts to learn.","""I may need to make progress in some places"", ""which is really my problem"", ""I need to redouble my efforts to learn""","The statement acknowledges the need for improvement ('make progress in some places') and accepts personal responsibility ('which is really my problem'). It emphasizes a commitment to increased effort ('redouble my efforts to learn'). There is no evidence of black-and-white thinking, exaggerated negativity, predicting the future, labeling self or others negatively, focusing on only the negative, assuming others' thoughts, or making absolute demands with 'should' statements. Instead, it reflects a realistic and responsible mindset without distortion.",No Distortion
3750,It's hard for me to be said not to be important.,It's hard for me to be said not to be important,"The statement reflects a difficulty accepting or believing that the speaker is not important. This suggests that the speaker is making assumptions about their own value based on feelings or internal experience rather than objective evidence. The phrase 'hard for me to be said not to be important' implies the individual feels emotionally that they must be important, and thus may view the idea of not being important as unacceptable or impossible. This aligns with Emotional Reasoning, where feelings are interpreted as facts, rather than more balanced thinking. There is no clear evidence of all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, labeling, etc., so Emotional Reasoning is the best fit.",Emotional Reasoning
